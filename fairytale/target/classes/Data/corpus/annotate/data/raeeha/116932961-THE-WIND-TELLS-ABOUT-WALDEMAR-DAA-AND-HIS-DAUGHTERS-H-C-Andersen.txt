When the wind sweeps across the grass , the field has a ripple like a pond , and when it sweeps across the corn the field waves to and fro like a high sea . That is called the wind 's dance ; but the wind does not dance only , he also tells stories ; and how loudly he can sing out of his deep chest , and how different it sounds in the tree-tops in the forest , and through the loopholes and clefts and cracks in walls ! Do you see how the wind drives the clouds up yonder , like a frightened flock of sheep ? Do you hear how the wind howls down here through the open valley , like a watchman blowing his horn ? With wonderful tones he whistles and screams down the chimney and into the fireplace . The fire crackles and flares up , and shines far into the room , and the little place is warm and snug , and it is pleasant to sit there listening to the sounds . Let the wind speak , for he knows plenty of stories and fairy tales , many more than are known to any of us . Just hear what the wind can tell . Huh -- uh -- ush ! roar along ! That is the burden of the song . `` By the shores of the Great Belt , one of the straits that unite the Cattegut with the Baltic , lies an old mansion with thick red walls , '' says the Wind . `` I know every stone in it ; I saw it when it still belonged to the castle of Marsk Stig on the promontory . But it had to be pulled down , and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion in another place , the baronial mansion of Borreby , which still stands by the coast . `` I knew them , the noble lords and ladies , the changing races that dwelt there , and now I 'm going to tell about Waldemar Daa and his daughters . How proudly he carried himself -- he was of royal blood ! He could do more than merely hunt the stag and empty the wine-can . ` It _ shall _ be done , ' he was accustomed to say . `` His wife walked proudly in gold-embroidered garments over the polished marble floors . The tapestries were gorgeous , the furniture was expensive and artistically carved . She had brought gold and silver plate with her into the house , and there was German beer in the cellar . Black fiery horses neighed in the stables . There was a wealthy look about the house of Borreby at that time , when wealth was still at home there . `` Four children dwelt there also ; three delicate maidens , Ida , Joanna , and Anna Dorothea : I have never forgotten their names . `` They were rich people , noble people , born in affluence , nurtured in affluence . `` Huh -- sh ! roar along ! '' sang the Wind ; and then he continued : `` I did not see here , as in other great noble houses , the high-born lady sitting among her women in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel : here she swept the sounding chords of the cithern , and sang to the sound , but not always old Danish melodies , but songs of a strange land . It was ` live and let live ' here : stranger guests came from far and near , the music sounded , the goblets clashed , and I was not able to drown the noise , '' said the Wind . `` Ostentation , and haughtiness , and splendor , and display , and rule were there , but the fear of the Lord was not there . `` And it was just on the evening of the first day of May , '' the Wind continued . `` I came from the west , and had seen how the ships were being crushed by the waves , with all on board , and flung on the west coast of Jutland . I had hurried across the heath , and over Jutland 's wood-girt eastern coast , and over the Island of Fuenen , and now I drove over the Great Belt , groaning and sighing . `` Then I lay down to rest on the shore of Seeland , in the neighborhood of the great house of Borreby , where the forest , the splendid oak forest , still rose . `` The young men-servants of the neighborhood were collecting branches and brushwood under the oak trees ; the largest and driest they could find they carried into the village , and piled them up in a heap , and set them on fire ; and men and maids danced , singing in a circle round the blazing pile . `` I lay quite quiet , '' continued the Wind ; `` but I silently touched a branch , which had been brought by the handsomest of the men-servants , and the wood blazed up brightly , blazed up higher than all the rest ; and now he was the chosen one , and bore the name the Street-goat , and might choose his Street-lamb first from among the maids ; and there was mirth and rejoicing , greater than I had ever heard before in the halls of the rich baronial mansion . `` And the noble lady drove towards the baronial mansion , with her three daughters , in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses . The daughters were young and fair -- three charming blossoms , rose , lily , and pale hyacinth . The mother was a proud tulip , and never acknowledged the salutation of one of the men or maids who paused in their sport to do her honor : the gracious lady seemed a flower that was rather stiff in the stalk . `` Rose , lily , and pale hyacinth ; yes , I saw them all three ! Whose lambkins will they one day become ? thought I ; their Street-goat will be a gallant knight , perhaps a prince . Huh -- sh ! hurry along ! hurry along ! `` Yes , the carriage rolled on with them , and the peasant people resumed their dancing . They rode that summer through all the villages round about . But in the night , when I rose again , '' said the Wind , `` the very noble lady lay down , to rise again no more : that thing came upon her which comes upon all -- there is nothing new in that . `` Waldemar Daa stood for a space silent and thoughtful . ` The proudest tree can be bowed without being broken , ' said a voice within him . His daughters wept , and all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes ; but Lady Daa had driven away -- and I drove away too , and rushed along , huh -- sh ! '' said the Wind . `` I returned again ; I often returned again over the Island of Fuenen , and the shores of the Belt , and I sat down by Borreby , by the splendid oak wood ; there the heron made his nest , and wood-pigeons haunted the place , and blue ravens , and even the black stork . It was still spring ; some of them were yet sitting on their eggs , others had already hatched their young . But how they flew up , how they cried ! The axe sounded , blow on blow : the wood was to be felled . Waldemar Daa wanted to build a noble ship , a man-of-war , a three-decker , which the king would be sure to buy ; and therefore the wood must be felled , the landmark of the seamen , the refuge of the birds . The hawk started up and flew away , for its nest was destroyed ; the heron and all the birds of the forest became homeless , and flew about in fear and in anger : I could well understand how they felt . Crows and ravens croaked aloud as if in scorn . ` Crack , crack ! the nest cracks , cracks , cracks ! ' `` Far in the interior of the wood , where the noisy swarm of labourers were working , stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters ; and all laughed at the wild cries of the birds ; only one , the youngest , Anna Dorothea , felt grieved in her heart ; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead , and on whose naked branches the black stork had built his nest , whence the little storks were stretching out their heads , she begged for mercy for the little things , and tears came into her eyes . Therefore the tree with the black stork 's nest was left standing . The tree was not worth speaking of . `` There was a great hewing and sawing , and a three-decker was built . The architect was of low origin , but of great pride ; his eyes and forehead told how clever he was , and Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to him , and so was Waldemar 's daughter Ida , the eldest , who was now fifteen years old ; and while he built a ship for the father , he was building for himself an airy castle , into which he and Ida were to go as a married couple -- which might indeed have happened , if the castle with stone walls , and ramparts , and moats had remained . But in spite of his wise head , the architect remained but a poor bird ; and , indeed , what business has a sparrow to take part in a dance of peacocks ? Huh -- sh ! I careered away , and he careered away too , for he was not allowed to stay ; and little Ida got over it , because she was obliged to get over it . `` The proud black horses were neighing in the stable ; they were worth looking at , and accordingly they _ were _ looked at . The admiral , who had been sent by the king himself to inspect the new ship and take measures for its purchase , spoke loudly in admiration of the beautiful horses . `` I heard all that , '' said the Wind . `` I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door , and strewed blades of straw like bars of gold before their feet . Waldemar Daa wanted to have gold , and the admiral wished for the proud black horses , and that is why he praised them so much ; but the hint was not taken , and consequently the ship was not bought . It remained on the shore covered over with boards , a Noah 's ark that never got to the water -- Huh -- sh ! rush away ! away ! -- and that was a pity . `` In the winter , when the fields were covered with snow , and the water with large blocks of ice that I blew up on to the coast , '' continued the Wind , `` crows and ravens came , all as black as might be , great flocks of them , and alighted on the dead , deserted , lonely ship by the shore , and croaked in hoarse accents of the wood that was no more , of the many pretty bird 's nests destroyed , and the little ones left without a home ; and all for the sake of that great bit of lumber , that proud ship that never sailed forth . `` I made the snow-flakes whirl , and the snow lay like a great lake high around the ship , and drifted over it . I let it hear my voice , that it might know what a storm has to say . Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship . Huh -- sh ! push along ! `` And the winter passed away ; winter and summer , both passed away , and they are still passing away , even as I pass away ; as the snow whirls along , and the apple blossom whirls along , and the leaves fall -- away ! away ! away ! and men are passing away too ! `` But the daughters were still young , and little Ida was a rose , as fair to look upon as on the day when the architect saw her . I often seized her long brown hair , when she stood in the garden by the apple tree , musing , and not heeding how I strewed blossoms on her hair , and loosened it , while she was gazing at the red sun and the golden sky , through the dark underwood and the trees of the garden . `` Her sister was bright and slender as a lily . Joanna had height and deportment , but was like her mother , rather stiff in the stalk . She was very fond of walking through the great hall , where hung the portraits of her ancestors . The women were painted in dresses of silk and velvet , with a tiny little hat , embroidered with pearls , on their plaited hair . They were handsome women . The gentlemen were represented clad in steel , or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel 's skin ; they wore little ruffs , and swords at their sides , but not buckled to their hips . Where would Joanna 's picture find its place on that wall some day ? and how would _ he _ look , her noble lord and husband ? This is what she thought of , and of this she spoke softly to herself . I heard it , as I swept into the long hall , and turned round to come out again . `` Anna Dorothea , the pale hyacinth , a child of fourteen , was quiet and thoughtful ; her great deep blue eyes had a musing look , but the childlike smile still played around her lips : I was not able to blow it away , nor did I wish to do so . `` We met in the garden , in the hollow lane , in the field and meadow ; she gathered herbs and flowers which she knew would be useful to her father in concocting the drinks and drops he distilled . Waldemar Daa was arrogant and proud , but he was also a learned man , and knew a great deal . That was no secret , and many opinions were expressed concerning it . In his chimney there was fire even in summer time . He would lock the door of his room , and for days the fire would be poked and raked ; but of this he did not talk much -- the forces of nature must be conquered in silence ; and soon he would discover the art of making the best thing of all -- the red gold . `` That is why the chimney was always smoking , therefore the flames crackled so frequently . Yes , I was there too , '' said the Wind . `` Let it go , I sang down through the chimney : it will end in smoke , air , coals and ashes ! You will burn yourself ! Hu-uh-ush ! drive away ! drive away ! But Waldemar Daa did _ not _ drive it away . '' `` The splendid black horses in the stable -- what became of them ? what became of the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests , the cows in the fields , and the house and home itself ? Yes , they may melt , may melt in the golden crucible , and yet yield no gold . `` Empty grew the barns and store-rooms , the cellars and magazines . The servants decreased in number , and the mice multiplied . Then a window broke , and then another , and I could get in elsewhere besides at the door , '' said the Wind . '' ` Where the chimney smokes the meal is being cooked , ' the proverb says . But here the chimney smoked that devoured all the meals , for the sake of the red gold . `` I blew through the courtyard-gate like a watchman blowing his horn , '' the Wind went on , `` but no watchman was there . I twirled the weathercock round on the summit of the tower , and it creaked like the snoring of the warder , but no warder was there ; only mice and rats were there . Poverty laid the tablecloth ; poverty sat in the wardrobe and in the larder ; the door fell off its hinges , cracks and fissures made their appearance , and I went in and out at pleasure ; and that is how I know all about it . `` Amid smoke and ashes , amid sorrow and sleepless nights , the hair and beard of the master turned gray , and deep furrows showed themselves around his temples ; his skin turned pale and yellow , as his eyes looked greedily for the gold , the desired gold . `` I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard : the result of his labor was debt instead of pelf . I sung through the burst window-panes and the yawning clefts in the walls . I blew into the chests of drawers belonging to the daughters , wherein lay the clothes that had become faded and threadbare from being worn over and over again . That was not the song that had been sung at the children 's cradle . The lordly life had changed to a life of penury . I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle , '' said the Wind . `` I snowed them up , and they say snow keeps people warm . They had no wood , and the forest from which they might have brought it was cut down . It was a biting frost . I rushed in through loopholes and passages , over gables and roofs , that I might be brisk . They were lying in bed because of the cold , the three high-born daughters ; and their father was crouching under his leathern coverlet . Nothing to bite , nothing to break , no fire on the hearth -- there was a life for high-born people ! Huh-sh , let it go ! But that is what my Lord Daa could _ not _ do -- he could _ not _ let it go . '' ` After winter comes spring , ' he said . ` After want , good times will come : one must not lose patience ; one must learn to wait ! Now my house and lands are mortgaged , it is indeed high time ; and the gold will soon come . At Easter ! ' `` I heard how he spoke thus , looking at a spider 's web . ` Thou cunning little weaver , thou dost teach me perseverance . Let them tear thy web , and thou wilt begin it again , and complete it . Let them destroy it again , and thou wilt resolutely begin to work again -- again ! That is what we must do , and that will repay itself at last . ' `` It was the morning of Easter-day . The bells sounded from the neighbouring church , and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky . The master had watched through the night in feverish excitement , and had been melting and cooling , distilling and mixing . I heard him sighing like a soul in despair ; I heard him praying , and I noticed how he held his breath . The lamp was burnt out , but he did not notice it . I blew at the fire of coals , and it threw its red glow upon his ghastly white face , lighting it up with a glare , and his sunken eyes looked forth wildly out of their deep sockets -- but they became larger and larger , as though they would burst . `` Look at the alchymic glass ! It glows in the crucible , red-hot , and pure and heavy ! He lifted it with a trembling hand , and cried with a trembling voice , ` Gold ! gold ! ' `` He was quite dizzy -- I could have blown him down , '' said the Wind ; `` but I only fanned the glowing coals , and accompanied him through the door to where his daughters sat shivering . His coat was powdered with ashes , and there were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair . He stood straight up , and held his costly treasure on high , in the brittle glass . ` Found , found ! -- Gold , gold ! ' he shouted , and again held aloft the glass to let it flash in the sunshine ; but his hand trembled , and the alchymic glass fell clattering to the ground , and broke into a thousand pieces ; and the last bubble of his happiness had burst ! Hu-uh-ush ! rushing away ! -- and I rushed away from the gold-maker 's house . `` Late in autumn , when the days are short , and the mist comes and strews cold drops upon the berries and leafless branches , I came back in fresh spirits , rushed through the air , swept the sky clear , and snapped the dry twigs -- which is certainly no great labor , but yet it must be done . Then there was another kind of sweeping clean at Waldemar Daa 's , in the mansion of Borreby . His enemy , Owe Rainel , of Basnaes , was there with the mortgage of the house and everything it contained in his pocket . I drummed against the broken window-panes , beat against the old rotten doors , and whistled through cracks and rifts -- huh-sh ! Mr. Owe Rainel did not like staying there . Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly ; Joanna stood pale and proud , and bit her thumb till it bled -- but what could that avail ? Owe Rainel offered to allow Waldemar Daa to remain in the mansion till the end of his life , but no thanks were given him for his offer . I listened to hear what occurred . I saw the ruined gentleman lift his head and throw it back prouder than ever , and I rushed against the house and the old lime trees with such force , that one of the thickest branches broke , one that was not decayed ; and the branch remained lying at the entrance as a broom when any one wanted to sweep the place out : and a grand sweeping out there was -- I thought it would be so .  aaaaa -RRB- aaa `` It was hard on that day to preserve one 's composure ; but their will was as hard as their fortune . `` There was nothing they could call their own except the clothes they wore : yes , there was one thing more -- the alchymist 's glass , a new one that had lately been bought , and filled with what had been gathered up from the ground of the treasure which promised so much but never kept its promise . Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom , and taking his stick in his hand , the once rich gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house of Borreby . I blew cold upon his heated cheeks , I stroked his gray beard and his long white hair , and I sang as well as I could , -- ` Huh-sh ! gone away ! gone away ! ' And that was the end of the wealth and splendor . `` Ida walked on one side of the old man , and Anna Dorothea on the other . Joanna turned round at the entrance -- why ? Fortune would not turn because she did so . She looked at the old walls of what had once been the castle of Marsk Stig , and perhaps she thought of his daughters : ` The eldest gave the youngest her hand . And forth they went to the far-off land . ' Was she thinking of this old song ? Here were three of them , and their father was with them too . They walked along the road on which they had once driven in their splendid carriage -- they walked forth as beggars , with their father , and wandered out into the open field , and into a mud hut , which they rented for a dollar and a half a year -- into their new house with the empty rooms and empty vessels . Crows and magpies fluttered above them , and cried , as if in contempt , ` Craw ! craw ! out of the nest ! craw ! craw ! ' as they had done in the wood at Borreby when the trees were felled . `` Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it . I blew about their ears , for what use would it be that they should listen ? `` And they went to live in the mud hut on the open field , and I wandered away over moor and field , through bare bushes and leafless forests , to the open waters , the free shores , to other lands -- huh-uh-ush ! -- away , away ! year after year ! '' And how did Waldemar Daa and his daughters prosper ? The Wind tells us : `` The one I saw last , yes , for the last time , was Anna Dorothea , the pale hyacinth : then she was old and bent , for it was fifty years afterwards . She lived longer than the rest ; she knew all . `` Yonder on the heath , by the Jutland town of Wiborg , stood the fine new house of the canon , built of red bricks with projecting gables ; the smoke came up thickly from the chimney . The canon 's gentle lady and her beautiful daughters sat in the bay window , and looked over the hawthorn hedge of the garden towards the brown heath . What were they looking at ? Their glances rested upon the stork 's nest without , and on the hut , which was almost falling in ; the roof consisted of moss and houseleek , in so far as a roof existed there at all -- the stork 's nest covered the greater part of it , and that alone was in proper condition , for it was kept in order by the stork himself . `` That is a house to be looked at , but not to be touched ; I must deal gently with it , '' said the Wind . `` For the sake of the stork 's nest the hut has been allowed to stand , though it was a blot upon the landscape . They did not like to drive the stork away , therefore the old shed was left standing , and the poor woman who dwelt in it was allowed to stay : she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that ; or was it perchance her reward , because she had once interceded for the nest of its black brother in the forest of Borreby ? At that time she , the poor woman , was a young child , a pale hyacinth in the rich garden . She remembered all that right well , did Anna Dorothea . '' ` Oh ! oh ! ' Yes , people can sigh like the wind moaning in the rushes and reeds . ` Oh ! oh ! ' '' she sighed , `` no bells sounded at thy burial , Waldemar Daa ! The poor schoolboys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of Borreby was laid in the earth to rest ! Oh , everything has an end , even misery . Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant . That was the hardest trial that befell our father , that the husband of a daughter of his should be a miserable serf , whom the proprietor could mount on the wooden horse for punishment ! I suppose he is under the ground now . And thou , Ida ? Alas , alas ! it is not ended yet , wretch that I am ! Grant me that I may die , kind Heaven ! ' `` That was Anna Dorothea 's prayer in the wretched hut which was left standing for the sake of the stork . `` I took pity on the fairest of the sisters , '' said the Wind . `` Her courage was like that of a man , and in man 's clothes she took service as a sailor on board of a ship . She was sparing of words , and of a dark countenance , but willing at her work . But she did not know how to climb ; so I blew her overboard before anybody found out that she was a woman , and according to my thinking that was well done ! '' said the Wind . `` On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa had fancied that he had found the red gold , I heard the tones of a psalm under the stork 's nest , among the crumbling walls -- it was Anna Dorothea 's last song . `` There was no window , only a hole in the wall . The sun rose up like a mass of gold , and looked through . What a splendor he diffused ! Her eyes were breaking , and her heart was breaking -- but that they would have done , even if the sun had not shone that morning on Anna Dorothea . `` The stork covered her hut till her death . I sang at her grave ! '' said the Wind . `` I sang at her father 's grave ; I know where his grave is , and where hers is , and nobody else knows it . `` New times , changed times ! The old high-road now runs through cultivated fields ; the new road winds among the trim ditches , and soon the railway will come with its train of carriages , and rush over the graves which are forgotten like the names -- hu-ush ! passed away , passed away ! `` That is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters . Tell it better , any of you , if you know how , '' said the Wind , and turned away -- and he was gone .
