The mayor stood at the open window . His shirt-frill was very fine , and so were his ruffles ; he had a breast-pin stuck in his frill , and was uncommonly smooth-shaven -- all his own work ; certainly he had given himself a slight cut , but he had stuck a bit of newspaper on the place . `` Hark ` ee , youngster ! '' he cried . The youngster in question was no other than the son of the poor washerwoman , who was just going past the house ; and he pulled off his cap respectfully . The peak of the said cap was broken in the middle , for the cap was arranged so that it could be rolled up and crammed into his pocket . In his poor , but clean and well-mended attire , with heavy wooden shoes on his feet , the boy stood there , as humble and abashed as if he stood opposite the king himself . `` You 're a good boy , '' said Mr. Mayor . `` You 're a civil boy . I suppose your mother is rinsing clothes down yonder in the river ? I suppose you are to carry that thing to your mother that you have in your pocket ? That 's a bad affair with your mother . How much have you got in it ? '' `` Half a quartern , '' stammered the boy , in a frightened voice . `` And this morning she had just as much , '' the mayor continued . `` No , '' replied the boy , `` it was yesterday . '' `` Two halves make a whole . She 's good for nothing ! It 's a sad thing with that kind of people ! Tell your mother that she ought to be ashamed of herself ; and mind you do n't become a drunkard -- but you will become one , though . Poor child -- there , go ! '' Accordingly the boy went on his way . He kept his cap in his hand , and the wind played with his yellow hair , so that great locks of it stood up straight . He turned down by the street corner , into the little lane that led to the river , where his mother stood by the washing bench , beating the heavy linen with the mallet . The water rolled quickly along , for the flood-gates at the mill had been drawn up , and the sheets were caught by the stream , and threatened to overturn the bench . The washerwoman was obliged to lean against the bench , to support it . `` I was very nearly sailing away , '' she said . `` It is a good thing that you are come , for I have need to recruit my strength a little . For six hours I 've been standing in the water . Have you brought anything for me ? '' The boy produced the bottle , and the mother put it to her mouth , and took a little . `` Ah , how that revives one ! '' she said : `` how it warms ! It is as good as a hot meal , and not so dear . And you , my boy ! you look quite pale . You are shivering in your thin clothes -- to be sure it is autumn . Ugh ! how cold the water is ! I hope I shall not be ill. . But no , I shall not be that ! Give me a little more , and you may have a sip too , but only a little sip , for you must not accustom yourself to it , my poor dear child ! '' And she stepped up to the bridge on which the boy stood , and came ashore . The water dripped from the straw matting she had wound round her , and from her gown . `` I work and toil as much as ever I can , '' she said , `` but I do it willingly , if I can only manage to bring you up honestly and well , my boy . '' As she spoke , a somewhat older woman came towards them . She was poor enough to behold , lame of one leg , and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her eyes , which was a blind one . The curl was intended to cover the eye , but it only made the defect more striking . This was a friend of the laundress . She was called among the neighbors , `` Lame Martha with the curl . '' `` Oh , you poor thing ! How you work , standing there in the water ! '' cried the visitor . `` You really require something to warm you ; and yet malicious folks cry out about the few drops you take ! '' And in a few minutes ' time the mayor 's late speech was reported to the laundress ; for Martha had heard it all , and she had been angry that a man could speak as he had done to a woman 's own child , about the few drops the mother took : and she was the more angry , because the mayor on that very day was giving a great feast , at which wine was drunk by the bottle -- good wine , strong wine . `` A good many will take more than they need -- but that 's not called drinking . _ They _ are good ; but _ you _ are good for nothing ! '' cried Martha , indignantly . `` Ah , so he spoke to you , my child ? '' said the washerwoman ; and her lips trembled as she spoke . `` So he says you have a mother who is good for nothing ? Well , perhaps he 's right , but he should not have said it to the child . Still , I have had much misfortune from that house . '' `` You were in service there when the mayor 's parents were alive , and lived in that house . That is many years ago : many bushels of salt have been eaten since then , and we may well be thirsty ; '' and Martha smiled . `` The mayor has a great dinner party to-day . The guests were to have been put off , but it was too late , and the dinner was already cooked . The footman told me about it . A letter came a little while ago , to say that the younger brother had died in Copenhagen . '' `` Died ! '' repeated the laundress -- and she became pale as death . `` Yes , certainly , '' said Martha . `` Do you take that so much to heart ? Well , you must have known him years ago , when you were in service in the house . '' `` Is he dead ? He was such a good , worthy man ! There are not many like him . '' And the tears rolled down her cheeks . `` Good heavens ! everything is whirling around me -- it was too much for me . I feel quite ill. '' And she leaned against the plank . `` Good heavens , you are ill indeed ! '' exclaimed the other woman . `` Come , come , it will pass over presently . But no , you really look seriously ill. . The best thing will be for me to lead you home . '' `` But my linen yonder -- '' `` I will take care of that . Come , give me your arm . The boy can stay here and take care of it , and I 'll come back and finish the washing ; that 's only a trifle . '' The laundress 's limbs shook under her . `` I have stood too long in the cold water , '' she said faintly , `` and I have eaten and drunk nothing since this morning . The fever is in my bones . O kind Heaven , help me to get home ! My poor child ! '' and she burst into tears . The boy wept too , and soon he was sitting alone by the river , beside the damp linen . The two women could make only slow progress . The laundress dragged her weary limbs along , and tottered through the lane and round the corner into the street where stood the house of the mayor ; and just in front of his mansion she sank down on the pavement . Many people assembled round her , and Lame Martha ran into the house to get help . The mayor and his guests came to the window . `` That 's the washerwoman ! '' he said . `` She has taken a glass too much . She is good for nothing . It 's a pity for the pretty son she has . I really like the child very well ; but the mother is good for nothing . '' Presently the laundress came to herself , and they led her into her poor dwelling , and put her to bed . Kind Martha heated a mug of beer for her , with butter and sugar , which she considered the best medicine ; and then she hastened to the river , and rinsed the linen -- badly enough , though her will was good . Strictly speaking , she drew it ashore , wet as it was , and laid it in a basket . Towards evening she was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress . The mayor 's cook had given her some roasted potatoes and a fine fat piece of ham , for the sick woman , and Martha and the boy discussed these viands while the patient enjoyed the smell , which she pronounced very nourishing . And presently the boy was put to bed , in the same bed in which his mother lay ; but he slept at her feet , covered with an old quilt made up of blue and white patches . Soon the patient felt a little better . The warm beer had strengthened her , and the fragrance of the provisions pleased her also . `` Thanks , you kind soul , '' she said to Martha . `` I will tell you all when the boy is asleep . I think he has dropped off already . How gentle and good he looks , as he lies there with his eyes closed . He does not know what his mother has suffered , and Heaven grant he may never know it . I was in service at the councillor 's , the father of the mayor . It happened that the youngest of the sons , the student , came home . I was young then , a wild girl , but honest , that I may declare in the face of Heaven . The student was merry and kind , good and brave . Every drop of blood in him was good and honest . I have not seen a better man on this earth . He was the son of the house , and I was only a maid , but we formed an attachment to each other , honestly and honourably . And he told his mother of it , for she was in his eyes as a Deity on earth ; and she was wise and gentle . He went away on a journey , but before he started he put his gold ring on my finger ; and directly he was gone my mistress called me . With a firm yet gentle seriousness she spoke to me , and it seemed as if Wisdom itself were speaking . She showed me clearly , in spirit and in truth , the difference there was between him and me . '' ` Now he is charmed with your pretty appearance , ' she said , ` but your good looks will leave you . You have not been educated as he has . You are not equals in mind , and there is the misfortune . I respect the poor , ' she continued ; ` in the sight of God they may occupy a higher place than many a rich man can fill ; but here on earth we must beware of entering a false track as we go onward , or our carriage is upset , and we are thrown into the road . I know that a worthy man wishes to marry you -- an artisan -- I mean Erich the glovemaker . He is a widower without children , and is well to do . Think it over . ' `` Every word she spoke cut into my heart like a knife , but I knew that my mistress was right , and that knowledge weighed heavily upon me . I kissed her hand , and wept bitter tears , and I wept still more when I went into my room and threw myself on my bed . It was a heavy night that I had to pass through . Heaven knows what I suffered and how I wrestled ! The next Sunday I went to the Lord 's house , to pray for strength and guidance . It seemed like a Providence , that as I stepped out of church Erich came towards me . And now there was no longer a doubt in my mind . We were suited to each other in rank and in means , and he was even then a thriving man . Therefore I went up to him , took his hand , and said , ` Are you still of the same mind towards me ? ' ` Yes , ever and always , ' he replied . ` Will you marry a girl who honors and respects , but who does not love you -- though that may come later ? ' I asked again . ` Yes , it will come ! ' he answered ; and upon this we joined hands . I went home to my mistress . I wore the gold ring that the son had given me at my heart . I could not put it on my finger in the daytime , but only in the evening when I went to bed . I kissed the ring again and again , till my lips almost bled , and then I gave it to my mistress , and told her the banns were to be put up next week for me and the glovemaker . Then my mistress put her arms round me and kissed me . _ She _ did not say that I was good for nothing ; but perhaps I was better then than I am now , though the misfortunes of life had not yet found me out . In a few weeks we were married ; and for the first year the world went well with us : we had a journeyman and an apprentice , and you , Martha , lived with us as our servant . '' `` Oh , you were a dear , good mistress , '' cried Martha . `` Never shall I forget how kind you and your husband were ! '' `` Yes , those were our good years , when you were with us . We had not any children yet . The student I never saw again . -- Yes , though , I saw him , but he did not see me . He was here at his mother 's funeral . I saw him stand by the grave . He was pale as death , and very downcast , but that was for his mother ; afterwards , when his father died , he was away in a foreign land , and did not come back hither . I know that he never married ; I believe he became a lawyer . He had forgotten me ; and even if he had seen me again , he would not have known me , I look so ugly . And that is very fortunate . '' And then she spoke of her days of trial , and told how misfortune had come as it were swooping down upon them . `` We had five hundred dollars , '' she said ; `` and as there was a house in the street to be bought for two hundred , and it would pay to pull it down and build a new one , it was bought . The builder and carpenter calculated the expense , and the new house was to cost ten hundred and twenty ! Erich had credit , and borrowed the money in the chief town , but the captain who was to bring it was shipwrecked , and the money was lost with him . '' `` Just at that time my dear sweet boy who is sleeping yonder was born . My husband was struck down by a long heavy illness : for three quarters of a year I was compelled to dress and undress him . We went back more and more , and fell into debt . All that we had was sold , and my husband died . I have worked , and toiled , and striven , for the sake of the child , and scrubbed staircases , washed linen , clean and coarse alike , but I was not to be better off , such was God 's good will . But He will take me to Himself in His own good time , and will not forsake my boy . '' And she fell asleep . Towards morning she felt much refreshed , and strong enough , as she thought , to go back to her work . She had just stepped again into the cold water , when a trembling and faintness seized her : she clutched at the air with her hand , took a step forward , and fell down . Her head rested on the bank , and her feet were still in the water : her wooden shoes , with a wisp of straw in each , which she had worn , floated down the stream , and thus Martha found her on coming to bring her some coffee . In the meantime a messenger from the mayor 's house had been dispatched to her poor lodging to tell her `` to come to the mayor immediately , for he had something to tell her . '' It was too late ! A barber-surgeon was brought to open a vein in her arm ; but the poor woman was dead . `` She has drunk herself to death ! '' said the mayor . In the letter that brought the news of his brother 's death , the contents of the will had been mentioned , and it was a legacy of six hundred dollars to the glovemaker 's widow , who had once been his mother 's maid . The money was to be paid , according to the mayor 's discretion , in larger or smaller sums , to her or to her child . `` There was some fuss between my brother and her , '' said the mayor . `` It 's a good thing that she is dead ; for now the boy will have the whole , and I will get him into a house among respectable people . He may turn out a reputable working man . '' And Heaven gave its blessing to these words . So the mayor sent for the boy , promised to take care of him , and added that it was a good thing the lad 's mother was dead , inasmuch as she had been good for nothing . They bore her to the churchyard , to the cemetery of the poor , and Martha strewed sand upon her grave , and planted a rose tree upon it , and the boy stood beside her . `` My dear mother ! '' he cried , as the tears fell fast . `` Is it true what they said : that she was good for nothing ? '' `` No , she was good for much ! '' replied the old servant , and she looked up indignantly . `` I knew it many a year ago , and more than all since last night . I tell you she was worth much , and the Lord in heaven knows it is true , let the world say as much as it chooses , ` She was good for nothing . ' ''
