by La Fontaine IF there 's a tale more common than the rest , The one I mean to give is such confessed . Why choose it then ? you ask ; at whose desire ? Hast not enough already tuned thy lyre ? What favor can thy MATRON now expect , Since novelty thou clearly dost neglect ? Besides , thou ` lt doubtless raise the critick 's rage . See if it looks more modern in my page . AT Ephesus , in former times , once shone , A fair , whose charms would dignify a throne ; And , if to publick rumor credit 's due , Celestial bliss her husband with her knew . Naught else was talked of but her beauteous face , And chastity that adds the highest grace ; From ev ` ry quarter numbers flocked to see This belle , regarded as from errors free . The honor of her sex , and country too ; As such , old mothers held her up to view , And wished their offspring 's wives like her to act : The sons desired the very same in fact ; From her , beyond a doubt , our PRUDES descend , An ancient , celebrated house , depend . THE spouse adored his beauteous charming wife : But soon , alas ! he lost his precious life ; ` Twere useless on particulars to dwell : His testament , indeed , provided well For her he loved on earth to fond excess , Which , ` yond a doubt , would have relieved distress ; Could gold a cherished husband 's loss repair , That filled her soul with black corroding care . A WIDOW , howsoever , oft appears Distracted ` mid incessant floods of tears , Who thoroughly her int ` rest recollects , And , spite of sobs , her property inspects . OUR Matron 's cries were loudly heard around , And feeling bosoms shuddered at the sound ; Though , we , on these occasions , truly know , The plaint is always greater than the woe . Some ostentation ever is with grief Those who weep most the soonest gain relief . EACH friend endeavored to console the fair ; Of sorrow , she 'd already had her share : 'Twas wrong herself so fully to resign ; -- Such pious preachings only more incline The soul to anguish ` mid distractions dire : Extremes in ev ` ry thing will soonest tire . AT length , resolved to shun the glorious light , Since her dear spouse no longer had the sight , O'erwhelmed with grief she sought Death 's dreary cell , Her love to follow , and with him to dwell . A SLAVE , through pity , with the widow went ; To live or die with her she was content ; To die , howe'er , she never could intend : No doubt she only thought about her friend , The mistress whom she never wished to quit , Since from her birth with her she used to sit . They loved each other with a friendship true : From early years it daily stronger grew ; Look through the universe you 'll scarcely find , So great a likeness , both in heart and mind . The slave , more clever than the lady fair , At first her mistress left to wild despair ; She then essayed to soothe each torment dire ; But reason 's fruitless , with a soul on fire . No consolation would the belle receive , For one no more , she constantly would grieve , And sought to follow him to regions blessed : -- The sword had shortest proved , if not the best . BUT still the lady anxious was to view , Again those precious relicks , and pursue , E ` en in the tomb what yet her soul held dear No aliment she took her mind to cheer ; The gate of famine was the one she chose , By which to leave this nether world of woes . A DAY she passed ; another day the same ; Her only sustenance , sobs , sighs , and flame Still unappeased ; she murmur 'd ` gainst her fate ; But nothing could her direful woes abate . ANOTHER corpse a residence had got , A trifling distance from the gloomy spot ; But very diff ` rent , since , by way of tomb , Enchained on gibbet was the latter 's doom ; To frighten robbers was the form designed , And show the punishment that rogues should find . A SOLDIER , as a sentinel was set , To guard the gallows , who good payment met ; 'Twas ruled , howe'er , if robbers , parents , friends , The body carried off , to make amends , The sentinel at once should take its place Severity too great for such a case ; But publick safety fully to maintain , 'Twas right the sentry pardon should not gain . WHILE moving round his post , he saw at night Shine , cross the tomb , a strange , unusual light , Which thither drew him , curious to unfold What , through the chinks , his eyesight could behold . OUR wight soon heard the lady 's cries distressed , On which he entered , and with ardor pressed , The cause of such excessive grief to know , And if 'twas in his pow ` r to ease her woe . DISSOLVED in tears , and quite o ` ercome with care ; She scarcely noticed that a man was there . The corpse , howe'er , too plainly told her pain , And fully seemed the myst ` ry to explain . We 've sworn , exclaimed the slave , what 's ` yond belief , That here we 'll die of famine and of grief . THOUGH eloquence was not the soldier 's art , He both convinced 'twas wrong with life to part : The dame was great attention led to pay , To what the son of Mars inclined to say , Which seemed to soften her severe distress : With time each poignant smart is rendered less . IF , said the soldier , you have made a vow , That you , some food to take will not allow ; Yet , looking on while I my supper eat , Will not prolong your lives , nor oaths defeat . HIS open manner much was formed to please ; The lady and her maid grew more at ease , Which made the gen ` rous sentinel conclude , To bring his meat they would not fancy rude . THIS done , the slave no longer was inclined To follow Death , as soon she changed her mind . Said she , good madam , pleasing thoughts I 've got ; Do n't you believe that , if you live or not , ` Tis to your husband ev ` ry whit the same ? Had you gone first , would he have had the name Of following to the grave as you design ? No , no , he 'd to another course incline . Long years of comfort we may clearly crave ; At twenty years it 's surely wrong to brave Both death and famine in a gloomy tomb There 's time enough to think of such a doom . At best , too soon we die ; do let us wait ; Here 's nothing now at least to haste our fate . In truth , I wish to see a good old age : To bury charms like your 's , would that be sage ? Of what advantage , I should wish to know , To carry beauty to the shades below ? Those heavenly features make my bosom sigh , To think from earthly praise they mean to fly . THIS flatt ` ry roused the beauteous widowed fair ; The god of soft persuasion soon was there , And from his quiver in a moment drew Two arrows keen , which from his bow-string flew ; With one he pierced the soldier to the heart , The lady slightly felt the other dart . Her youth and beauty , spite of tears , appeared , And men of taste such charms had long revered ; A mind of tender feeling might , through life . Have loved her -- even though she were a wife . THE sentinel was smitten with her charms ; Grief , pity , sighs , belong to Cupid 's arms ; When bosoms heave and eyes are drowned in tears , Then beauty oft with conq ` ring grace appears . BEHOLD our widow list ` ning to his praise , Incipient fuel Cupid 's flame to raise ; Behold her , even glad to view the wight , Whose well tim 'd flatt ` ry filled her with delight AT length , to eat he on the fair prevailed , And pleased her better than the dead bewailed . So well he managed , that she changed her plan , And , by degrees , to love him fondly ` gan . The son of Mars a darling husband grew , While yet her former dear was full in view . MEANTIME the corpse , that long in chains had swung , By thieves was carried off from where it hung . The noise was heard , and thither ran our wight ; But vain his efforts : -- they were out of sight ; Confused , distressed , he sought again the tomb , To tell his grief and settle , ` mid the gloom , How best to act , and where his head to hide , Since hang he must , the laws would now decide . THE slave replied , your gibbet-thief , you say , Some lurking rogues this night have borne away : The law , it seems , will ne'er accord you grace The corpse that 's here , let 's set in t ` other 's place : The passers-by the change will never tell The lady gave consent , and all was well . O FICKLE females , ever you 're the same ; A woman 's a woman , both in mind and name Some fair we find , and some unlike the dove , But CONSTANCY 'S the highest charm of love . YE prudes , for ever doubt of full success ; Do n't boast at all : too much you may profess , How good soever your design may be , Not less is ours , you easily may see ; The MATRON 'S tale is not beyond belief : To entertain , our object is in chief . THE widow 's only errors were her cries ; And mad design her life to sacrifice ; For , merely setting husband-dead in place of one of this patibulary race , Was surely not a fault so very grave : Her lover 's life was what she sought to save . A LIVING drum-boy , truly be it said , Is better far , than any monarch dead .
