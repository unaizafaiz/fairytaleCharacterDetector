NO master sage , nor orator I know , Who can success , like gentle Cupid show ; His ways and arguments are pleasing smiles , Engaging looks , soft tears , and winning wiles . Wars in his empire will at times arise , And , in the field , his standard meet the eyes ; Now stealing secretly , with skilful lure . He penetrates to hearts supposed secure , O'erleaps the ramparts that protect around , And citadels reduces , most renowned . I DARE engage , two fortresses besiege Leave one to Mars , and t ` other to this liege . And though the god of war should numbers bring , With all the arms that can his thunders fling , Before the fort he 'll vainly waste his time , While Cupid , unattended , in shall climb , Obtain possession perfectly at ease , And grant conditions just as he shall please . I NOW propose to give a fav ` rite tale : -- The god of Love was never known to fail , In finding stratagems , as I have read , And many have I seen most nicely spread . THE young Aminta was Gerontes ' wife , With whom she lived , it seems , a wretched life . Far better she deserved than what she had , For he was jealous , and his temper bad : An aged hunks , while she was in the hour When hearts , that never felt LOVE 'S mighty pow ` r , Are presently by tender objects caught , Which ne'er before had entered in the thought . WHEN first Aminta saw young Cleon 's face , A lad possessing all engaging grace , Much prudence then she ev ` ry way displayed , E ` en more perhaps than necessary made . For though we may suppose the lovely fair , Would ev ` ry effort use to ` scape the snare , Yet when the god of soft persuasion takes The fatal moment , havock soon he makes , In vain his duty , any thing opposed , If once the tender sentiment 's disclosed . Aminta consolation had in view 'Twas that alone the passion from her drew , A meeting innocent , to vent her tears , And , to a feeling friend , express her fears . ` Tis represented thus I can not doubt ; But sight of meat brings appetite about ; And if you would avoid the tempting bit , ` Tis better far at table not to sit . AMINTA hoped to render Cleon kind ; Poor innocent ! as yet to dangers blind , These conversations she was led to deem , Mere friendly ways that raised sincere esteem ; And this alone she ardently desired , Without supposing more would be required , Or any thing improper be the case : She 'd rather die than suffer such disgrace . 'Twas difficult the business to commence ; A letter 's often lost , or gives offence , And many serious accidents arrive : To have a confidant ` twere better strive ; But where could such a female friend be found ? Gerontes dreaded was by all around . I 've said already , Cupid will obtain , One way or t ` other , what he wants to gain ; And this will show the observation just The maxim 's such as you may always trust . A FEMALE relative young Cleon had , A peevish prude , who looked upon the lad , As one she had a right to rule and scold ; Her name was Mistress Alice : sour and old . ONE summer 's day , Aminta to her said : I can not think how ` tis , your cousin 's led , -LRB- Though quite indifferent he is to me , And doubtless such will ever prove to be -RRB- With various fond attentions , to pretend , He loves me -- much beyond a common friend . My window oft he passes day and night ; I can not move a step , but he 's in sight , And in a moment at my heels appears ; Notes , letters full of soft expressions , dears , To me are sent by one I will not name , For known to you , she would be thought to blame : Pray put an end to such a wild pursuit It nothing can produce but wretched fruit ; My husband may take fire at things like these ; And as to Cleon . -- me he 'll never please ; I 'll thank you to inform him what I say ; Such steps are useless : folly they betray . MUCH praise Aminta from the dame received ; Who promised that the conduct , which aggrieved ; To Cleon she would mention , as desired , And reprimand him , as the fault required : So well would scold him , that she might be sure , From him in future she would be secure . THE foll ` wing day our youth to Alice came ; To pay a visit solely was his aim ; She told him what Aminta had declared , And , in her lecture , words by no means spared . The lad , surprised , on oath the whole denied , And vowed to gain her love , he never tried . Old Alice called her cousin , imp of Hell ; Said she , in all that 's wicked , you excel ; You will not all your base designs confess ; The oaths are false on which you lay such stress , And punishment most richly you deserve ; But false or true , from this I will not swerve , That you should recollect , Aminta 's chaste , And never will submit to be disgraced ; Renounce her from this hour ; no more pursue : -- That easily , said Cleon , I can do ; Away he went : the case considered o ` er ; But still the myst ` ry he could not explore . THREE days had scarcely passed : Aminta came , To pay a visit to our ancient dame ; Cried she I fear , you have not seen as yet , This youth , who worse and worse appears to get . Rage , Mistress Alice , instantly o ` erspread , And ev ` ry thing that 's vile she of him said . NO sooner had Aminta gone away , But she for Cleon sent without delay . He presently appeared ; yet to detail How Alice stormed , I certainly should fail ; Unless an iron tongue I could obtain : All Hell was ransacked epithets to gain ; And Lucifer and Beelzebub were used : No mortal ever was so much abused . QUITE terrified , poor lad , he scarcely knew ; Her fury was so great , what best to do ; If he allowed that he had acted wrong , ` Twould wound his conscience and defile his tongue . He home repaired , and turning in his mind What he had heard , at length his thoughts inclined , To fancy that Aminta was disposed , To play some cunning trick , which , not disclosed , Would operate to bring her wish about ; I see , said he , the scheme I should not doubt ; It surely is my duty kind to be : Methinks I hear her freely say to me , O Cleon ! show affection , I am yours ; I love her too , for beauty that secures ; And while her seraph charms my bosom fire ; I equally the stratagem admire . Most freely howsoe'er I will confess , At first I was so dull , I could not guess At what she aimed , but now the object 's plain : Aminta o ` er my heart desires to reign . THIS minute , if I durst , I 'd thither go , And , full of confidence , declare my woe , The subtle flame that burns without controul ; What hurt to paint feelings of my soul ? From balance of accounts ` twill both exempt : ` Tis better far to love than show contempt . But should the husband find me in the house ? -- Ne'er think of that , and try the hunks to chouse . THEIR course had hardly run three other days , When fair Aminta , studious still of ways To have her wish , again to Alice came , To give dear Cleon notice of her flame . My home , cried she , ` tis requisite I leave : To ruin me , your cousin , I perceive , Is still resolved , for presents now he sends ; But he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends ; I 'm clearly not the woman he suspects : See here , what jewels rare to please the sex ! Nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more , My portrait I have found among the store , Which must have been from memory designed , Since only with my husband that you 'll find . WHEN I arose , this person known to you , Whose name I must conceal -LRB- to honor true -RRB- , Arrived and brought me what I just have shown ; The whole should at your cousin 's head be thrown ; And were he present : -- but I 'll curb my rage ; Allow me to proceed , and you engage To hear the rest : -- he word has also sent , That as to-day he knew my husband went On business to his cottage in the wood , Where he would sleep the night , he understood , No sooner should the servants be in bed , And Morpheus ' robe be o ` er their senses spread , But to my dressing room he would repair : -- What can he hope , such project to declare ? A meeting place indeed ! -- he must be mad ; Were I not fearful ` twould affliction add To my old husband , I would set a watch , Who , at the entrance , should the villain catch ; Or put him instantly to shame and flight ; This said , she presently was out of sight . AN hour had passed when Cleon came anew ; The jewels at him in a moment flew ; And scarcely Mistress Alice could refrain , From wreaking further vengeance on the swain . Is this your plan ? cried she ; but what is worse , I find you still desire a greater curse ; And then she told him all Aminta said , When last to visit her the fair was led . HIMSELF most fully warned the youth now thought ; I loved , cried he , ` tis true ; but that is naught , Since nothing from the belle I must expect : In future her completely I 'll neglect . That is the line , said Alice , you should take ; The lad howe'er was fully now awake , And thoroughly resolved to seek the dame , Whose cunning wiles had set him in a flame . THE midnight hour the clock no sooner told ; Than Cleon ran the myst ` ry to unfold , And to the spot repaired , which he supposed , Aminta meant , from what had been disclosed ; The place was well described , and there he found ; Awaiting at the door , this belle renowned , Without attendants : sleep their eyes o ` erspread : Behind thick clouds the very stars had fled : As all had been expected , in he went , Most thoroughly they both appeared content ; Few words were used : in haste the pair withdrew , Where ev ` ry wish at ease they might pursue . The smart gallant at once her beauty praised ; His admiration presently was raised ; Sweet kindness followed ; charms were oft admired ; And all was managed as their hearts desired . SAID youthful Cleon , now you 'll tell me why This stratagem you were induced to try ? For such before in love was never seen ; ` Tis excellent , and worthy Beauty 's queen . A lovely blush o ` erspread Aminta 's face , And gave her lily-cheeks superior grace . He praised her person , artifice , and wit , And did whate'er the moments would admit .
