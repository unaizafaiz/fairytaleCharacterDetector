by La Fontaine SOME wit , handsome form and gen ` rous mind ; A triple engine prove in love we find ; By these the strongest fortresses are gained E ` en rocks ` gainst such can never be sustained . If you 've some talents , with a pleasing face , Your purse-strings open free , and you 've the place . At times , no doubt , without these things , success Attends the gay gallant , we must confess ; But then , good sense should o ` er his actions rule ; At all events , he must not be a fool . The stingy , women ever will detest ; Words puppies want ; -- the lib ` ral are the best . A Florentine , MAGNIFICENT by name , Was what we 've just described , in fact and fame ; The title was bestowed upon the knight , For noble deeds performed by him in fight . The honor ev ` ry way he well deserved ; His upright conduct -LRB- whence he never swerved , -RRB- Expensive equipage , and presents made , Proclaimed him all around what we 've pourtrayed . WITH handsome person and a pleasing mien , Gallant , a polished air , and soul serene ; A certain fair of noble birth he sought , Whose conquest , doubtless , brilliant would be thought ; Which in our lover doubly raised desire ; Renown and pleasure lent his bosom fire . THE jealous husband of the beauteous fair Was Aldobrandin , whose suspicious care Resembled more , what frequently is shown For fav ` rites mistresses , than wives alone . He watched her every step with all his eyes ; A hundred thousand scarcely would suffice ; Indeed , quite useless Cupid these can make ; And Argus oft is subject to mistake : Repeatedly they 're duped , although our wight , -LRB- Who fancied he in ev ` ry thing was right , -RRB- Himself so perfectly secure believed , By gay gallants he ne'er could be deceived . TO suitors , howsoe'er , he was not blind ; To covet presents , greatly he inclined . The lover yet had no occasion found , To drop a word to charms so much renowned ; He thought his passion was not even seen ; And if it had , would things have better been ? What would have followed ? what had been the end ? The reader needs no hint to comprehend . BUT to return to our forlorn gallant , Whose bosom for the lady 's ` gan to pant ; He , to his doctor , not a word had said ; Now here , now there , he tried to pop his head . But neither door nor window could he find , Where he might glimpse the object of his mind , Or even hear her voice , or sound her name ; No fortress had he ever found the same ; Yet still to conquer he was quite resolved , And oft the manner in his mind revolved . This plan at length he thought would best succeed , To execute it doubtless he had need Of ev ` ry wily art he could devise , Surrounded as he was by eagle-eyes . I THINK the reader I 've already told , Our husband loved rich presents to behold ; Though none he made , yet all he would receive ; Whate'er was offered he would never leave . MAGNIFICENT a handsome horse had got , It ambled well , or cantered , or would trot ; He greatly valued it , and for its pace , 'Twas called the Pad ; it stept with wond ` rous grace : By Aldobrandin it was highly praised ; Enough was this : the knight 's fond hopes were raised ; Who offered to exchange , but t ` other thought , He in a barter might perhaps be caught . ` Tis not , said he , that I the horse refuse ; But I , in trucking , never fail to lose . ON this , Magnificent , who saw his aim ; Replied , well , well , a better scheme we 'll frame ; No changing we 'll allow , but you 'll permit , That for the horse , I with your lady sit , You present all the while , ` tis what I want ; I 'm curious , I confess , and fort it pant . Besides , your friends assuredly should know What mind , what sentiments may from her flow . Just fifteen minutes , I no more desire : What ! cried the other , you my wife require ? No , no , pray keep your horse , that wo n't be right . But you 'll be present , said the courteous knight . And what of that ? rejoined the wily spouse . Why , cried Magnificent , then naught should rouse Your fears or cares , for how can ill arise , While watched by you , possessed of eagle-eyes ? THE husband ` gan to turn it in his mind ; Thought he , if present , what can be designed ? The plan is such as dissipates my fears ; The offer advantageous too appears ; He 's surely mad ; I ca n't conceive his aim ; But , to secure myself and wife from shame ; Without his knowledge , I 'll forbid the fair Her lips to open , and for this prepare . COME , cried old Aldobrandin , I 'll consent : But , said the other , recollect ` tis meant , So distant from us , all the while you stay , That not a word you hear of what I say . Agreed , rejoined the husband : -- let 's begin ; Away he flew , and brought the lady in . WHEN our gallant the charming belle perceived ; Elysium seemed around , he half believed . The salutations o ` er , they went and sat Together in a corner , where their chat Could not be heard , if they to talk inclined ; Our brisk gallant no long harangues designed , But to the point advanced without delay ; Cried he , I 've neither time nor place to say What I could wish , and useless ` twere to seek Expressions that but indirectly speak The sentiments which animate the soul ; In terms direct , ` tis better state the whole . THUS circumstanced , fair lady , let me , pray ; To you at once , my adoration pay ; No words my admiration can express ; Your charms enslave my senses , I confess ; Can you suppose to answer would be wrong ? Too much good sense to you should now belong ; Had I the leisure , I 'd in form disclose The tender flame with which my bosom glows ; Each horrid torment ; but by Fate denied Blessed opportunities , let me not hide , While moments offer , what pervades my heart , And openly avow the burning smart Few minutes I have got to travel o ` er What gen ` rally requires six months or more . Cold is that lover who will not pursue , With ev ` ry ardor , beauty , when in view . But why this silence ? -- not a word you say ! You surely will not send me thus away ! That heav ` n , an angel made you , none deny ; But still , to what is asked you should reply . Your husband this contrived I plainly see , Who fancies that replies were not to be , Since in our bargain they were never named ; For shuffling conduct he was ever famed ; But I 'll come round him , spite of all his art ; I can reply for you , and from the heart , Since I can read your wishes in your eyes ; ` Tis thus to say -- Good , sir , I would advise That you regard me , not as marble cold ; Your various tournaments and actions bold , Your serenades , and gen ` ral conduct prove , What tender sentiments your bosom move . YOUR fond affection constantly I praised , And quickly felt a flame within me raised ; Yet what avails ? -- Oh , that I 'll soon disclose ; Since we agree , allow me to propose , Our mutual wishes we enjoy to-night ; And turn to ridicule that jealous Wight ; In short , reward him for his wily fear , In watching us so very closely here . Your garden will be quite the thing , I guess ; Go thither , pray , and never fear success ; Depend upon it , soon his country seat Your spouse will visit : -- then the hunks we 'll cheat . When plunged in sleep the grave duennas lie , Arise , furred gown put on , and quickly fly ; With careful steps you 'll to the garden haste ; I 've got a ladder ready to be placed Against the wall which joins your neighbour 's square : I 've his permission thither to repair ; ` Tis better than the street : -- fear naught my dove . -- Ah ! dear Magnificent , my fondest love ; As you desire , I 'll readily proceed ; My heart is your 's : we fully are agreed . ` T 's you who speaks , and , would that in my arms Permission I had got to clasp your charms ! MAGNIFICENT -LRB- for her he now replied , -RRB- This flame you 'll soon no reason have to hide Through dread or fear of my old jealous fool , Who wisely fancies he can woman rule . THE lover , feigning rare , the lady left , And grumbling much , as if of hope bereft , Addressed the husband thus : you 're vastly kind ; As well with no-one converse I might find ; If horses you so easily procure , You Fortune 's frowns may very well endure . Mine neighs , at least , but this fair image seems , Mere pretty fish ; I 've satisfied my schemes ; What now of precious minutes may remain , If any one desire my chance to gain , A bargain he shall have : -- most cheap the prize ; The husband laughed till tears bedewed his eyes . Said he , these youths have always in their head Some wond ` rous fancies ; follies round them spread . Friend , from pursuit you much too soon retire : With time we oft obtain our fond desire . But I shall always keep a watchful eye ; Some knowing tricks methinks I yet can spy ; Howe'er , the horse must now be clearly mine , And you 'll the pad of course to me resign ; To you no more expense ; and from to-day , Be not displeased to see me on it , pray ; At ease I 'll ride my country house to view ; -- That very night he to the mansion flew , And our good folks immediately repaired , Where gay Magnificent no pains had spared To get access ; what passed we wo n't detail ; Soft scenes , you 'll doubtless guess , should there prevail . THE dame was lively , beautiful , and young ; The lover handsome , finely formed , and strong ; Alike enchanted with each other 's charms , Three meetings were contrived without alarms ; A fair so captivating to possess , What mortal could be satisfied with less ? In golden dreams the sage duennas slept ; A female sentinel to watch was kept . A SUMMER-HOUSE was at the garden end , Which to the pair much ease was found to lend ; Old Aldobrandin , when he built the same , Ne'er fancied LOVE , would in it freak and game . In cuckoldom he took his full degrees ; The horse he daily mounted at his ease , And so delighted with his bargain seemed , Three days , to prove it , requisite he deemed . The country house received him ev ` ry night ; At home he never dreamed but all was right . WHAT numbers round , whom Fortune favors less ; Have got a wife , but not a horse possess ; And , what yet still more wond ` rous may appear , Know ey ` ry thing that passes with their dear .
