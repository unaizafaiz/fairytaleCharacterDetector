HE surely must be wrong who loving fears ; And does not flee when beauty first appears . Ye FAIR , with charms divine , I know your fame ; No more I 'll burn my fingers in the flame . From you a soft sensation seems to rise , And , to the heart , advances through the eyes ; What there it causes I 've no need to tell : Some die of love , or languish in the spell . Far better surely mortals here might do ; There 's no occasion dangers to pursue . By way of proof a charmer I will bring , Whose beauty to a hermit gave the sting : Thence , save the sin , which fully I except ; A very pleasant intercourse was kept ; Except the sin , again I must repeat , My sentiments on this will never meet The taste of him at Rome , who wine had swilled , Till , to the throat , he thoroughly was filled , And then exclaimed , is ` t not a sin to drink ? Such conduct horrid ever I shall think ; I wish to prove , e ` en saints in fear should live ; The truth is clear : -- our faults may Heav ` n forgive ; If dread of punishment , from pow ` rs divine , Had led this friar in the proper line , He never had the charming girl retained , Who , young and artless , would your heart have gained . HER name was Alibech , if I recollect ; Too innocent , deceptions to detect . One day this lovely maiden having read , How certain pious , holy saints were led , The better to observe religious care , To seek retirement in some lorn repair , Where they , like Heav ` nly Angels , moved around , Some here , some there , were in concealment found , Was quite delighted , strange as it may seem , And presently she formed the frantick scheme , Of imitating those her mind revered , And to her plan most rigidly adhered . WITH silent steps the innocent withdrew ; To mothers , sisters , -- none she bade adieu . Long time she walked through fields , and plain , and dale ; At length she gained a wood within a vale ; There met an aged man , who once might be , Gay , airy , pleasing , blithe , gallant , and free , But now a meager skeleton was seen The shadow only of what late he 'd been : Said she , good father , I have much desire To be a saint : thither my hopes aspire ; I fain would merit reverence and prayer , A festival have kept with anxious care ; What pleasure , ev ` ry year , the palm in hand , And , beaming round the head , a holy band , Nice presents , flow ` rs , and off ` rings to receive Your practice difficult must I believe ? Already I can fast for many days , And soon should learn to follow all your ways . Go , said the aged man , your plan resign ; I 'd have you , as a friend , the state decline ; ` Tis not so easy sanctity to meet , That fasting should suffice the boon to greet . Heav ` n guards from ill the maids and wives who fast , Or holiness would very seldom last . ` Tis requisite to practice other things ; These secrets are , which move by hidden springs ; A hermit , whom you 'll find beneath yon ' beech , Can , better far than I , their virtues teach ; Go , seek him , pray , make haste if you are sage ; I ne'er retain such birds within my cage . This having said , at once he left the belle , And wisely shut the door , and barred his cell : Not trusting hair-cloth , fasting , age , nor gout ; With beauty , anchorites themselves should doubt . OUR pensive fair soon found the person meant , A man whose soul was on religion bent ; His name was Rustick , young and warm in prayer ; Such youthful hermits of deception share . Her holy wish , the girl to him expressed , A wish most fervent doubtless to be blessed , And felt so strongly , Alibech had fear , Some day the mark might on her fruit appear . A SMILE her innocence from Rustick drew ; Said he , in me you little learning view ; But what I 've got , I 'll readily divide , And nothing from your senses try to hide . THE hermit surely would have acted right ; Such pupil to have sent away at sight . He managed otherwise , as we shall state ; The consequences , let us now relate . SINCE much he wished perfection to pursue ; He , to himself , exclaimed : what can ` st thou do ? Watch , fast , and pray ; wear hair-cloth too ; but this Is surely little that will lead to bliss ; All do as much , but with a FAIR to dwell , And , never touch her , would be to excel ; ` Twere triumph ` mong the Heav ` nly Angels thought ; Let 's merit it , and keep what here is brought ; If I resist a thing so sweet and kind , I gain the end that pow ` rs divine designed . HE with him let the charming belle remain ; And confident he could at will abstain , Both Satan and the flesh at once defied : Two foes on mischief ready to decide . BEHOLD our saints together in a hut ; Young Rustick , where a corner seemed to jut ; A bed of rushes for the novice placed , Since sleeping on the floor had her debased , Who , yet unused to hardships , much must feel : 'Twas best that these should on her senses steal . A little fruit , and bread not over fine , She had for supper : -- water too for wine . The hermit fasted ; but the lady fed , And ate with appetite her fruit and bread . APART their place of rest , the maiden slept , But something quite awake the other kept : The Devil could by no means quiet rest , Till he should get admitted as a guest . He was received within the humble cell ; The friar 's thoughts were on his smiling belle , Her simple manners , fascinating grace , Complexion , age ; each feature he would trace ; The heaving bosom , and the beauteous charms ; That made him wish to clasp her in his arms . BY passion moved , he bade at once adieu , To hair-cloth , discipline , and fasting too ; Cried he , my saints are these ; to them I 'll pray ; From Alibech no longer he would stay , But to her flew , and roused the girl from sleep : Said he , so soon you should not silence keep , It is not right : -- there 's something to be done , Ere we suspend the converse we 've begun : ` Tis proper that , to please the pow ` rs divine ; We Satan instantly in Hell confine ; He was created for no other end ; To block him up let 's ev ` ry effort lend . IMMEDIATELY within the bed he slid , When , scarcely knowing what young Rustick did ; And , unaccustomed to the mystick scene , She knew not what the anchorite could mean , Nor this nor that but , partly by consent , And partly force , yet wishing to prevent , Though not presuming to resist his sway To him ` mid pain and pleasure , she gave way , Believing ev ` ry thing was most exact , And , what the saint performed , a gracious act , By thus the Devil shutting up in Hell , Where he was destined with his imps to dwell . HENCEFORTH 'twas requisite , if saint she 'd be ; From martyrdom she must not think to flee , For friar Rustick little sought to please : The lesson was not given quite at ease , Which made the girl -LRB- not much improved in wit -RRB- Exclaim , this Devil mischief will commit ; ` Tis very plain , though strange it may appear To hurt his prison e ` en he 'll persevere ; The injury now you clearly may perceive ; But , for the evil done , I shall not grieve : Yet richly he deserves to be again Shut up effectually in his domain . IT shall be so , the anchorite replied ; Once more the mystick art was fully tried ; Such care he took , such charity was shown , That Hell , by use , free with the Devil grown , His presence pleasant always would have found ; Could Rustick equally have kept his ground . CRIED Alibech , ` tis very truly said , No prison has so nice and soft a bed , But presently the host will weary grow ; And here our pair soon discord seemed to show : Hell , for the prisoner , in vain inquired ; Deaf was the fiend , and quietly retired ; Repeated calls of course must irksome prove : The fair grew weary , when he would not move ; Her strong desire to be a saint declined ; And Rustick to get rid of her designed ; In this with him the belle agreed so well , That secretly she left the hermit 's cell , And home returned in haste the shortest way ; But what the fair could to her parents say , Is what I fain would know , though truly yet ; The full particulars I ne'er could get . ` Tis probable she made them understand , Her heart was prompted by divine command ; To try to be a saint ; that they believed , Or seemingly for truth the tale received . Perhaps the parents were not quite exact , In narrowly examining the fact ; Though some suspicions doubtless might arise About her Hell , they could not well disguise ; But ` tis so formed that little can be seen , And many jailors in it duped have been . FOR Alibech great feasting was prepared , When , through simplicity , the girl declared , To those around , without the least restraint , How she had acted to be made a saint . You 'd surely no occasion , they replied , To go so far instruction to provide , When at your house you might have had , with ease , Like secret lectures , just as you should please . Said one , my brother could the thing have done ; Another cried , -- my cousin would have run To do the same ; or Neherbal , who 's near , No novice in the business would appear ; He seeks your hand , which you 'll be wise to take Before he learns -- what might a diff ` rence make . She took the hint , and he the fair received ; A handsome fortune many fears relieved ; This joined to num ` rous charms that had the belle ; He fancied pure a most suspicious Hell , And freely used the blessings Hymen sends ; May Heav ` n like joys bestow on all our friends !
