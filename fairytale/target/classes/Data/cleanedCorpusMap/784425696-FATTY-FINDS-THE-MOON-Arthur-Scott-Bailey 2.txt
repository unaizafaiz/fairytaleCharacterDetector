Wandering through the woods one day , Fatty Coon 's bright eyes caught a strange gleam from something -- something that shone and glittered out of the green . Fatty wanted to see what it was , though he hardly thought it was anything to eat . But whenever he came upon something new he always wanted to examine it . So now Fatty hurried to see what the strange thing was . It was the oddest thing he had ever found -- flat , round , and silvery ; and it hung in the air , under a tree , just over Fatty 's head . Fatty Coon looked carefully at the bright thing . He walked all around it , so he could see it from all sides . And at last he thought he knew what it was . He made up his mind that it was the moon ! He had often seen the moon up in the sky ; and here it was , just the same size exactly , hanging so low that he could have reached it with his paw . He saw nothing strange in that ; for he knew that the moon often touched the earth . Had he not seen it many a time , resting on the side of Blue Mountain ? One night he had asked his mother if he might go up on the mountain to play with the moon ; but she had only laughed . And here , at last , was the moon come to him ! Fatty was so excited that he ran home as fast as he could go , to tell his mother , and his brother Blackie , and Fluffy and Cutey , his sisters . `` Oh ! the moon ! the moon ! '' Fatty shouted . He had run so fast that , being so plump , he was quite out of breath . And that was all he could say . `` Well , well ! What about the moon ! '' Mrs. Coon asked . `` Anybody would think you had found it , almost . '' And she smiled . Fatty puffed and gasped . And at last he caught his breath again . `` Yes -- I 've found it ! It 's over in the woods -- just a little way from here ! '' he said . `` Big , and round , and shiny ! Let 's all go and bring it home ! '' `` Well , well , well ! '' Mrs. Coon was puzzled . She had never heard of the moon being found in those woods ; and she hardly knew what to think . `` Are you sure ? '' she asked . `` Oh , yes , Mother ! '' Fatty could hardly wait , he was so eager to lead the way . And with many a shake of the head , Mrs. Coon , with her family , started off to see the moon . `` There ! '' Fatty cried , as they came in sight of the bright , round thing . `` There it is -- just as I told you ! '' And they all set up a great shouting . All but Mrs. Coon . She was n't quite sure , even yet , that Fatty had really found the moon . And she walked close to the shining thing and peered at it . But not too close ! Mrs. Coon did n't go too near it . And she told her children quite sternly to stand back . It was well that she did ; for when Mrs. Coon took her eyes off Fatty 's moon and looked at the ground beneath it -- well ! she jumped back so quickly that she knocked two of her children flat on the ground . A trap ! THAT was what Mrs. Coon saw right in front of her . And Farmer Green , or his boy , or whoever it was that set the trap , had hung that bright piece of TIN over the trap hoping that one of her family would see it and play with it -- and fall into the trap . Yes -- it was a mercy that Fatty had n't begun knocking it about . For if he had he would have stepped right into the trap and it would have shut -- SNAP ! Just like that . And there he would have been , caught fast . It was no wonder that Mrs. Coon hurried her family away from that spot . And Fatty led them all home again . He could n't get away from his moon fast enough .
