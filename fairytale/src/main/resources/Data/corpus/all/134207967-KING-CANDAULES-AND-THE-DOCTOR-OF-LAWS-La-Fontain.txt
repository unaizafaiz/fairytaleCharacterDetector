IN life oft ills from self-imprudence spring ; As proof , Candaules ' story we will bring ; In folly 's scenes the king was truly great : His vassal , Gyges , had from him a bait , The like in gallantry was rarely known , And want of prudence never more was shown . MY friend , said he , you frequently have seen The beauteous face and features of the queen ; But these are naught , believe me , to the rest , Which solely can be viewed when quite undressed . Some day I 'll let you gratify your eyes ; Without her knowledge I 'll means devise ; But on condition : -- you 'll remember well What you behold , to no one you will tell , In ev ` ry step most cautiously proceed , And not your mind with silly wishes feed ; No sort of pleasure surely I could take , To see vain passion you her lover make . You must propose , this charming form to view , As if mere marble , though to nature true ; And I 'm convinced you 'll readily declare , Beyond nor art can reach , nor thought prepare ; Just now I left her in the bath at ease : A judge you are , and shall the moment seize ; Come , witness my felicity supreme ; You know her beauties are my constant theme . AWAY they went , and Gyges much admired ; Still more than that : in truth his breast was fired ; For when she moved astonishment was great , And ev ` ry grace upon her seemed to wait . Emotion to suppress howe'er he tried , Since he had promised what he felt to hide ; To hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise Suspicions of designs and mystick ways . Exaggeration was the better part , And from the subject he would never start , But fully praised each beauty in detail , Without appearing any thing to veil . Gods ! Gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed ; The skin how fair -- how charming all the rest ! THIS am ` rous conversation by the queen Was never heard , or she 'd enraged have been ; In ancient days of ignorance , we find , The sex , to show resentment , much inclined ; In diff ` rent light at present this appears , And fulsome praises ne'er offend their ears . OUR arch observer struggled with his sighs Those feelings much increased , so fair the prize : The prince , in doubt , conducted him away ; But in his heart a hundred arrows lay ; Each magick charm directed pointed darts ; To flee were useless : LOVE such pain imparts , That nothing can at times obstruct its course ; So quick the flight : so truly great the force . WHILE near the king , much caution Gyges showed ; But soon the belle perceived his bosom glowed ; She learned the cause : -- her spouse the tale disclosed , And laughed and jeered , as he the facts exposed : A silly blockhead ! not to know a queen Could raillery not bear on such a scene . But had it pleased her wishes , still ` twere right -LRB- Such honour 's dictates -RRB- to discover spite ; And this she truly did , while in her mind , To be revenged she fully was inclined . FOR once , good reader , I should wish thee wife ; Or otherwise , thou never can ` st in life , Conceive the lengths a woman oft will go , Whose breast is filled with wrath and secret woe . A mortal was allowed these charms to view , Which others ' eyes could never dare pursue . Such treasures were for gods , or rather kings The privilege of both are beauteous things . THESE thoughts induced the queen revenge to seek ; Rage moved her breast , and shame possessed her cheek . E ` en Cupid , we are told , assistance gave ; What from his aim effectually can save ? Fair in person was Gyges to behold ; Excuses for her easy ` twere to mould ; To show her charms , what baseness could excel ? And on th ' exposer all her hatred fell . Besides , he was a husband , which is worse With these each sin receives a double curse . What more shall I detail ? -- the facts are plain : Detested was the king : -- beloved the swain ; All was accomplished , and the monarch placed Among the heroes who with horns are graced ; No doubt a dignity not much desired , Though in repute , and easily acquired . SUCH merit had the prince 's folly got , ` In petto ' , Vulcan 's brother was his lot ; The distance thence is little to the HAT : The honor much the same of this or that . SO far 'twas passing well , but , in the intrigue ; The cruel Parcae now appeared to league ; And soon the lovers , on possession bent , To black Cocytus ' shores the monarch sent ; Too much of certain potions forced to drink , He quickly viewed the dreary , horrid brink ; While pleasing the objects Gyges ' eyes beheld ; And in the palace presently he dwelled , For , whether love or rage the widow fired , Her throne and hand she gave , as was required . T ' EXTEND this tale was never my design ; Though known full well , I do not now repine ; The case so thoroughly my purpose served . Ne'er from the narrative the object swerved ; And scarcely can I fancy , better light The DOCTOR will afford to what I write . The scenes that follow I from Rome have drawn ; Not Rome of old , ere manners had their dawn , When customs were unpleasant and severe The females , silly , and gallants in fear ; But Rome of modern days , delightful spot ! Where better tastes have into fashion got , And pleasure solely occupies the mind To rapture ev ` ry bosom seems resigned . A tempting journey truly it appears , For youths from twenty on to thirty years . NOT long ago , then , in the city dwelled , A master , who in teaching law excelled ; In other matters he , howe'er , was thought A man that jollity and laughter sought . He criticised whatever passed around , And oft , at others ' cost , diversion found . IT happened that our learned doctor had , Among his many pupils -LRB- good and bad -RRB- A Frenchman , less designed to study laws , Than , in amours , perhaps , to gain applause . One day , observing him with clouded mien , My friend , said he , you surely have the spleen , And , out of college , nothing seem to do ; No law books read : -- some object I 'd pursue ; A handsome Frenchman should his hours improve ; Seek soft intrigues , or as a lover move ; Talents you have , and gay coquettes are here Not one , thank heav ` n , but numbers oft appear . THE student answered , I am new at Rome , And , save the belles who sell their beauteous bloom , I ca n't perceive , gallants much business find , Each house , like monasteries , is designed , With double doors , and bolts , and matrons sour , And husbands Argus-eyed , who 'd you devour . Where can I go to follow up your plan , And hope , in spots like these , a flame to fan ? ` Twere not less difficult to reach the moon , And with my teeth I 'd bite it just as soon . HA ! HA ! replied the doctor with delight , The honor which you do us is not slight ; I pity men quite fresh and raw like you ; Our town , I see , you 've hardly traveled through , You fancy then , such wily snares are set , ` Tis difficult intrigues in Rome to get . I 'd have you know , we 've creatures who devise , To horn their husbands under Argus ' eyes . ` Tis very common ; only try around , And soon you 'll find , that sly amours abound . Within the neighb ` ring church go take your place , And , to the dames who pass in search of grace , Present your fingers dipt in water blessed : -- A sign for those who wish to be caressed . In case the suppliant 's air some lady please , Who knows her trade , and how to act at ease , She 'll send a message , something to desire : You 'll soon be found , wherever you retire , Though lodged so secretly , that God alone , Till then , your place of residence had known . An aged female will on you attend , Who , used to this , will full assistance lend , Arrange an interview with wily art ; No trouble take , you 'll have an easy part ; No trouble did I say ? why , that 's too much ; Some things I would except , their pow ` r is such ; And proper ` tis , my friend , that I should hint , Attentions you at Rome should well imprint , And be discrete ; in France you favors boast : Of ev ` ry moment here you make the most ; The Romans to the greatest lengths proceed . So best , the spark replied , I like the deed ; And , though no Gascon , I may boldly say ; Superior prowess always I display . Perhaps 'twas otherwise , for ev ` ry wight ; In this , to play the Gascon , thinks it right . To all the doctor 's words our youth adhered , And presently within a church appeared , Where daily came the choicest belles around , And loves and graces in their train were found , Or , if ` tis wished in modern phrase to speak , Attention num ` rous angels there would seek . Beneath their veils were beauteous sparkling eyes ; The holy-water scarcely would suffice . IN lucky spot the spark his station took , And gave to each that passed a plaintive look ; To some he bowed ; to others seemed to pray , And holy water offered on their way . One angel ` mong the rest the boon received , With easy pleasing air , that much relieved ; On which the student to himself expressed , A fond belief , with her he might be blessed . WHEN home , an aged female to him came , And soon a meeting place he heard her name . To count particulars howe'er were vain Their pranks were many , and their folly plain ; The belle was handsome ; ev ` ry bliss was sought , And all their moments most delightful thought . HE , to the doctor , ev ` ry matter told Discretion in a Frenchman would be cold ; ` Tis out of nature , and bespeaks the cit ; Smells strong of shop , and would not fashion fit . THE learned teacher satisfaction showed , That such success from his instructions flowed , Laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights , Who had not wit to guard connubial rights , And from their lamb the wily wolf to keep : A shepherd will o ` erlook a hundred sheep , While foolish man 's unable to protect , E ` en one where most he 'd wish to be correct . Howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard , But not a thing impossible to guard ; And if he had not got a hundred eyes , Thank heav ` n , his wife , though cunning to devise , He could defy : -- her thoughts so well he knew , That these intrigues she never would pursue . YOU 'LL , ne'er believe , good reader , without shame , The doctor 's wife was she our annals name ; And what 's still worse , so many things he asked , Her look , air , form , and secret charms unmasked , That ev ` ry answer fully seemed to say , 'Twas clearly she , who thus had gone astray . One circumstance the lawyer led to doubt : Some talents had the student pointed out , Which she had never to her husband shown , And this relief administered alone . Thought he , those manners not to her belong , But all the rest are indications strong , And prove the case ; yet she at home is dull ; While this appears to be a prattling trull , And pleasing in her conversation too ; In other matters ` tis my wife we view , Form , face , complexion , features , eyes , and hair , The whole combined pronounces her the fair . AT length , when to himself the sage had said ` Tis she ; and then , ` tis not ; -- his senses led To make him in the first opinion rest , You well may guess what rage was in his breast . A second meeting you have fixed ? cried he ; Yes , said the Frenchman , that was made with glee ; We found the first so pleasing to our mind , That to another both were well inclined , And thoroughly resolved more fun to seek . That 's right , replied the doctor , have your freak ; The lady howsoe'er I now could name . The scholar answered , that to me 's the same ; I care not what she 's called , Nor who she be : ` Tis quite enough that we so well agree . By this time I 'm convinced her loving spouse . Possesses what an anchorite might rouse ; And if a failure any where be met , At such a place to-morrow one may get , What I shall hope , exactly at the hour , To find resigned and fully in my pow ` r : IN bed I shall be instantly received , And from anxiety be soon relieved . The place of meeting is a room below , Most nicely furnished , rich , but void of show . At first I through a passage dark was led , Where Sol 's bright rays are ne'er allowed to spread ; But soon , by my conductress , I was brought , ` Mid LOVE 'S delights , where all with charms was frought . ON this you may suppose the doctor 's pain ; But presently he thought a point to gain , And take the student 's place by wily art , Where , acting in disguise the lover 's part , His rib he might entangle in a net , And vassalage bestow she 'd ne'er forget . Our learned man was clearly in the wrong ; ` Twere better far to sleep and hold his tongue ; Unless , with God 's assistance , he could raise A remedy that merited full praise . Whenever wives have got a candidate , To be admitted to the Cuckold 's state , If thence he get scot free ` tis luck indeed ; But once received , and ornaments decreed , A blot the more will surely nothing add , To one already in the garment clad . The doctor otherwise however thought ; Yet still his reason no advantage brought ; Indeed he fancied , if he could forestall The youth who now he might his master call ; The trick would to his wisdom credit do , And show , superior wiles he could pursue . AWAY the husband hastened to the place ; In full belief , that , hiding well his face , And favored by the darkness of the spot , The silence marked , and myst ` ry of the plot , He , undiscovered , safely might be led , Where such delicious fruits were ready spread . MISFORTUNE , howsoe'er , would so direct The aged female nothing to neglect , Had with her got a lantern to conduct , The light from which at will she could obstruct , And , far more cunning than our learned sage , Perceived at once with whom she had t ` engage ; But , marking no surprise , she bade him wait , While she , his coming , to her dame should state . Said she , unless I tell her first you 're here , I dare not let you in her room appear . Besides , you have not got the right attire ; Undressed , in truth , is what she would desire . My lady , you must know , is gone to bed : -- Then , thrusting in a dressing room his head , He there beheld the necessary fare , Of night-cap , slippers , shirt , and combs for hair , With perfumes too , in Rome the nicest known , And fit for highest cardinals to own . His clothes the learned doctor laid aside ; The aged female came his steps to guide ; Through passages she led him by the hand , Where all was dark , and many turnings planned ; At once bewildered , and deprived of sight , The lawyer tottered much for want of light . At length she ope 'd a door , and pushed the sage , Where most unpleasantly he must engage , Though doubtless ev ` ry way his proper place : -- The school where he was used the LAWS to trace ! O'ercome with shame , confusion , and surprise , He nearly fainted , vain ` twere to disguise . THE circumstances ran throughout the town ; Each student then was waiting in his gown ; Enough , no doubt , his fortunes to destroy ; The laugh went round , and all was jest and joy . What , is he mad ? said they , or would he seek Some lass , and with her wish to have a freak ? Still worse arrived : -- his beauteous spouse complained ; A trial followed , and distractions reigned ; Her relatives supported well the cause , And represented , that the MAN of LAWS , Occasioned jars and matrimonial strife ; That he was mad , and she , a prudent wife , The marriage was annulled , and she withdrew : Retirement now the lady would pursue , In Vavoureuse a prelate blessed the dame , And , at Saint Croissant , she a nun became .
