I designed , after my first voyage , to spend the rest of my days at Bagdad ; but it was not long ere I grew weary of a quiet life . My inclination to trade revived . I bought goods suited to the commerce I intended , and put to sea a second time , with merchants of known probity . We embarked on board a good ship , and after recommending ourselves to God , set sail . We traded from island to island , and exchanged commodities with great profit . One day we landed on an island covered with several sorts of fruit trees , but so unpeopled , that we could see neither man nor beast upon it . We went to take a little fresh air in the meadows , and along the streams that watered them . Whilst some diverted themselves with gathering flowers , and others with gathering fruits , I took my wine and provisions , and sat down by a stream betwixt two great trees , which formed a curious shape . I made a very good meal , and afterwards fell asleep . I can not tell how long I slept , but when I awoke the ship was gone . I was very much surprised to find the ship gone . I got up and looked about everywhere , and could not see one of the merchants who landed with me . At last I perceived the ship under sail , but at such a distance that I lost sight of her in a very little time . I leave you to guess at my melancholy reflections in this sad condition . I was ready to die with grief : I cried out sadly , beat my head and breast , and threw myself down upon the ground , where I lay some time in a terrible agony . I upbraided myself a hundred times for not being content with the produce of my first voyage , that might well have served me all my life . But all this was in vain , and my repentance out of season . At last I resigned myself to the will of God ; and not knowing what to do , I climbed up to the top of a great tree , from whence I looked about on all sides to see if there was anything that could give me hope . When I looked towards the sea , I could see nothing but sky and water , but looking towards the land I saw something white ; and , coming down from the tree , I took up what provision I had left and went towards it , the distance being so great that I could not distinguish what it was . When I came nearer , I thought it to be a white bowl of a prodigious height and bigness ; and when I came up to it I touched it , and found it to be very smooth . I went round to see if it was open on any side , but saw it was not , and that there was no climbing up to the top of it , it was so smooth . It was at least fifty paces round . By this time the sun was ready to set , and all of a sudden the sky became as dark as if it had been covered with a thick cloud . I was much astonished at this sudden darkness , but much more when I found it was occasioned by a bird , of a monstrous size , that came flying toward me . I remembered a fowl , called roc , that I had often heard mariners speak of , and conceived that the great bowl , which I so much admired , must needs be its egg . In short , the bird lighted , and sat over the egg to hatch it . As I perceived her coming , I crept close to the egg , so that I had before me one of the legs of the bird , which was as big as the trunk of a tree . I tied myself strongly to it with the cloth that went round my turban , in hopes that when the roc flew away next morning she would carry me with her out of this desert island . And after having passed the night in this condition , the bird really flew away next morning , as soon as it was day , and carried me so high that I could not see the earth . Then she descended all of a sudden , with so much rapidity that I lost my senses ; but when the roc was settled , and I found myself upon the ground , I speedily untied the knot , and had scarcely done so when the bird , having taken up a serpent of a monstrous length in her bill , flew away . The place where she left me was a very deep valley , encompassed on all sides with mountains , so high that they seemed to reach above the clouds , and so full of steep rocks that there was no possibility of getting out of the valley . This was a new perplexity , so that when I compared this place with the desert island from which the roc brought me , I found that I had gained nothing by the change . As I walked through this valley I perceived it was strewn with diamonds , some of which were of surprising bigness . I took a great deal of pleasure in looking at them ; but speedily I saw at a distance such objects as very much diminished my satisfaction , and which I could not look upon without terror ; they were a great number of serpents , so big and so long that the least of them was capable of swallowing an elephant . They retired in the day-time to their dens , where they hid themselves from the roc , their enemy , and did not come out but in the night-time . I spent the day in walking about the valley , resting myself at times in such places as I thought most suitable . When night came on I went into a cave , where I thought I might be in safety . I stopped the mouth of it , which was low and straight , with a great stone , to preserve me from the serpents , but not so exactly fitted as to hinder light from coming in . I supped on part of my provisions , but the serpents , which began to appear , hissing about in the meantime , put me into such extreme fear that you may easily imagine I did not sleep . When day appeared the serpents retired , and I came out of the cave trembling . I can justly say that I walked a long time upon diamonds without feeling an inclination to touch any of them . At last I sat down , and notwithstanding my uneasiness , not having shut my eyes during the night , I fell asleep , after having eaten a little more of my provisions ; but I had scarcely shut my eyes when something that fell by me with great noise awakened me . This was a great piece of fresh meat , and at the same time I saw several others fall down from the rocks in different places . I had always looked upon it as a fable when I heard mariners and others discourse of the valley of diamonds , and of the stratagems made use of by some merchants to get jewels from thence ; but now I found it to be true . For , in reality , those merchants come to the neighborhood of this valley when the eagles have young ones , and throwing great joints of meat into the valley , the diamonds , upon whose points they fall , stick to them ; the eagles , which are stronger in this country than anywhere else , pounce with great force upon those pieces of meat , and carry them to their nests upon the top of the rocks to feed their young with , at which time the merchants , running to their nests , frighten the eagles by their noise , and take away the diamonds that stick to the meat . And this stratagem they make use of to get the diamonds out of the valley , which is surrounded with such precipices that nobody can enter it . I believed till then that it was not possible for me to get out of this abyss , which I looked upon as my grave ; but now I changed my mind , for the falling in of those pieces of meat put me in hopes of a way of saving my life . I began to gather together the largest diamonds that I could see , and put them into the leathern bag in which I used to carry my provisions . I afterwards took the largest piece of meat I could find , tied it close round me with the cloth of my turban , and then laid myself upon the ground , with my face downward , the bag of diamonds being tied fast to my girdle , so that it could not possibly drop off . I had scarcely laid me down before the eagles came . Each of them seized a piece of meat , and one of the strongest having taken me up , with a piece of meat on my back , carried me to his nest on the top of the mountain . The merchants fell straightway to shouting , to frighten the eagles ; and when they had obliged them to quit their prey , one of them came to the nest where I was . He was very much afraid when he saw me , but recovering himself , instead of inquiring how I came thither , he began to quarrel with me , and asked why I stole his goods . ` You will treat me , ' replied I , ` with more civility when you know me better . Do not trouble yourself ; I have diamonds enough for you and myself too , more than all the other merchants together . If they have any , it is by chance ; but I chose myself in the bottom of the valley all those which you see in this bag ' ; and having spoken those words , I showed them to him . I had scarcely done speaking , when the other merchants came trooping about us , much astonished to see me ; but they were much more surprised when I told them my story . Yet they did not so much admire my stratagem to save myself as my courage to attempt it . They took me to the place where they were staying all together , and there having opened my bag , they were surprised at the largeness of my diamonds , and confessed that in all the courts where they had been they had never seen any that came near them . I prayed the merchant to whom the nest belonged -LRB- for every merchant had his own -RRB- , to take as many for his share as he pleased . He contented himself with one , and that too the least of them ; and when I pressed him to take more , without fear of doing me any injury , ` No , ' said he , ` I am very well satisfied with this , which is valuable enough to save me the trouble of making any more voyages to raise as great a fortune as I desire . ' I spent the night with those merchants , to whom I told my story a second time , for the satisfaction of those who had not heard it . I could not moderate my joy when I found myself delivered from the danger I have mentioned . I thought I was in a dream , and could scarcely believe myself to be out of danger . The merchants had thrown their pieces of meat into the valley for several days , and each of them being satisfied with the diamonds that had fallen to his lot , we left the place next morning all together , and traveled near high mountains , where there were serpents of a prodigious length , which we had the good fortune to escape . We took ship at the nearest port and came to the Isle of Roha , where the trees grow that yield camphor . This tree is so large , and its branches so thick , that a hundred men may easily sit under its shade . The juice of which the camphor is made runs out from a hole bored in the upper part of the tree , is received in a vessel , where it grows thick , and becomes what we call camphor ; and the juice thus drawn out the tree withers and dies . There is in this island the rhinoceros , a creature less than the elephant , but greater than the buffalo ; it has a horn upon its nose about a cubit long ; this horn is solid , and cleft in the middle from one end to the other , and there are upon it white lines , representing the figure of a man . The rhinoceros fights with the elephant , runs his horn into him , and carries him off upon his head ; but the blood of the elephant running into his eyes and making him blind , he falls to the ground , and then , strange to relate , the roc comes and carries them both away in her claws to be food for her young ones . Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for good merchandise . From thence we went to other isles , and at last , having touched at several trading towns of the main land , we landed at Balsora , from whence I went to Bagdad . There I immediately gave great alms to the poor , and lived honourably upon the vast riches I had gained with so much fatigue .
