WHEN Venus and Hypocrisy combine , Oft pranks are played that show a deep design ; Men are but men , and friars full as weak : I 'm not by Envy moved these truths to speak . Have you a sister , daughter , pretty wife ? Beware the monks as you would guard your life ; If in their snares a simple belle be caught : The trap succeeds : to ruin she is brought . To show that monks are knaves in Virtue 's mask ; Pray read my tale : -- no other proof I ask . A HERMIT , full of youth , was thought around , A saint , and worthy of the legend found . The holy man a knotted cincture wore ; But , ` neath his garb : -- heart-rotten to the core . A chaplet from his twisted girdle hung , Of size extreme , and regularly strung , On t ` other side was worn a little bell ; The hypocrite in ALL , he acted well ; And if a female near his cell appeared , He 'd keep within as if the sex he feared , With downcast eyes and looks of woe complete , You 'd ne'er suppose that butter he could eat . NOT far from where the hermit 's cell was placed , Within a village dwelled a widow chaste ; Her residence was at the further end And all her store -- a daughter as a friend , Who candor , youth , and charms supreme possessed ; And still a virgin lived , howe'er distressed . Though if the real truth perhaps we name , 'Twas more simplicity than virtuous aim ; Not much of industry , but honest heart ; No wealth , nor lovers , who might hope impart . In Adam 's days , when all with clothes were born , She doubtless might like finery have worn ; A house was furnished then without expense ; For sheets or mattresses you 'd no pretence ; Not e ` en a bed was necessary thought No blankets , pillowbiers , nor quilts were bought . Those times are o ` er ; then Hymen came alone ; But now a lawyer in his train is shown . OUR anchorite , in begging through the place ; This girl beheld , -- but not with eyes of grace . Said he , she 'll do , and , if thou manag ` st right , Lucius , at times , with her to pass the night . No time he lost , his wishes to secure : The means , we may suppose , not over pure . QUITE near the open fields they lived , I 've said ; An humble , boarded cottage o ` er their head . One charming night -- no , I mistake ` tis plain , Our hermit , favored much by wind and rain , Pierced in the boarding , where by time 'twas worn ; A hole through which he introduced a horn ; And loudly bawled : -- attend to what I say , Ye women , my commands at once obey . This voice spread terror through the little cot ; Both hid their heads and trembled for their lot ; But still our monk his horn would sound aloud Awake ! cried he ; your favor God has vowed ; My faithful servant , Lucius , haste to seek ; At early dawn go find this hermit meek To no one say a word : ` tis Heav ` n ordains ; Fear nothing , Lucius ever blessed remains ; I 'll show the way myself : your daughter place , Good widow , with this holy man of grace ; And from their intercourse a pope shall spring , Who back to virtue christendom will bring . HE spoke to them so very loud and clear , They heard , though ` neath the clothes half dead with fear . Some time howe'er the females lay in dread ; At length the daughter ventured out her head , And , pulling hastily her parent 's arm , Said she , dear mother , -LRB- not suspecting harm -RRB- Good Heav ` ns ! must I obey and thither go ? What would the holy man on me bestow ? I know not what to say nor how to act ; Now cousin Anne would with him be exact , And better recollect his sage advice : -- Fool ! said the mother , never be so nice ; Go , nothing fear , and do whate'er 's desired ; Much understanding will not be required ; The first or second time thou ` lt get thy cue , And cousin Anne will less know what to do . Indeed ? the girl replied ; well , let 's away , And we 'll return to bed without delay . But softly , cried the mother with a smile ; Not quite so fast , for Satan may beguile ; And if ` twere so , hast taken proper care ? I think he spoke like one who would ensnare . To be precipitate , in such a case , Perhaps might lead at once to dire disgrace . If thou wert terrified and did ` st not hear , Myself I 'm sure was quite o ` ercome with fear . No , no , rejoined the daughter , I am right : I clearly heard , dear mother , spite of fright . Well then , replied the widow , let us pray , That we by Satan be not led astray . AT length they both arose when morning came , And through the day the converse was the same . At night howe'er the horn was heard once more , And terrified the females as before . Thou unbelieving woman , cried the voice , For certain purposes of God the choice ; No more delay , but to the hermit fly , Or ` tis decreed that thou shalt quickly die . Now , mother , said the girl , I told you well ; Come , let us hasten to the hermit 's cell ; So much I dread your death , I 'll nothing shun ; And if ` tis requisite , I 'll even run . Away then , cried the mother , let us go ; Some pains to dress , the daughter would bestow , Without reflecting what might be her fare : -- To PLEASE is ev ` ry blooming lass 's care . OUR monk was on the watch you may suppose ; A hole he made that would a glimpse disclose ; By which , when near his cell the females drew , They might , with whip in hand the hermit view , Who , like a culprit punished for his crimes , Received the lash , and that so many times , It sounded like the discipline of schools , And made more noise than flogging fifty fools . WHEN first our pilgrims knocked , he would not hear ; And , for the moment , whipping would appear ; The holy lash severely he applied , Which , through the hole , with pain our females spied ; At length the door he ope 'd , but from his eyes No satisfaction beamed : he showed surprise . With trembling knees and blushes o ` er the face , The widow now explained the mystick case . Six steps behind , the beauteous daughter stood , And waited the decree she thought so good . The hypocrite howe'er the hermit played , And sent these humble pilgrims back dismayed . Said he , the evil spirit much I dread ; No female to my cell should e ` er be led ; Excuse me then : such acts would sorrow bring ; From me the HOLY FATHER ne'er spring . What ne'er from you ? the widow straight replied : And why should not the blessing , pray , be tried ? No other answer howsoe'er she got ; So back they trudged once more to gain their cot . Ah ! mother , said the girl , ` tis my belief , Our many heavy sins have caused thus grief . WHEN night arrived and they in sleep were lost , Again the hermit 's horn the woodwork crossed ; Return , return , cried he with horrid tone ; To-morrow you 'll have due attention shown ; I 've changed the hermit 's cold fastidious mind , And when you come , he 'll act as I 've designed . THE couple left their bed at break of day , And to the cell repaired without delay Our tale to shorten , Lucius kind appeared To rigid rules no longer he adhered . The mother with him let her girl remain , And hastened to her humble roof again . The belle complying looked : -- he took her arm , And soon familiar grew with ev ` ry charm . O HYPOCRITES ! how oft your wily art Deceives the world and causes poignant smart . AT matins they so very often met , Some awkward indications caused regret . The fair at length her apron-string perceived Grew daily shorter , which her bosom grieved ; But nothing to the hermit she 'd unfold , Nor e ` en those feelings to her mother told ; She dreaded lest she should be sent away , And be deprived at once of Cupid 's play . You 'll tell me whence so much discernment came ? From this same play : -- the tree of art by name . For sev ` n long months the nymph her visits paid ; Her inexperience doubtless wanted aid . BUT when the mother saw her daughter 's case , She made her thank the monk , and leave the place . The hermit blessed the Lord for what was done ; A pleasant course his humble slave had run . He told the mother and her daughter fair , The child , by God 's permission , gifts would share . Howe'er , be careful , said the wily wight , That with your infant ev ` ry thing goes right ; To you , from thence , great happiness will spring : You 'll reign the parent of what 's more than king ; Your relatives to noble rank will rise : Some will be princes ; others lords comprise ; Your nephews cardinals ; your cousins too Will dukes become , if they the truth pursue ; And places , castles , palaces , there 'll be , For you and them of every high degree ; You 'll nothing want : eternal is the source , Like waters flowing in the river 's course . This long prediction o ` er : with features grave , His benediction to them both he gave . WHEN home returned , the girl , each day and night , Amused her mind with prospects of delight ; By fancy 's aid she saw the future pope , And all prepared to greet her fondest hope ; But what arrived the whole at once o ` erthrew Hats , dukedoms , castles , vanished from the view : The promised elevation of the NAME Dissolved to air : - a little female came !
