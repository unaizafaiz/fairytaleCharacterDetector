In a narrow crooked street , among other abodes of poverty , stood an especially narrow and tall house built of timber , which time had knocked about in such fashion that it seemed to be out of joint in every direction . The house was inhabited by poor people , and the deepest poverty was apparent in the garret lodging in the gable , where , in front of the only window , hung an old bent birdcage , which had not even a proper water-glass , but only a bottle-neck reversed , with a cork stuck in the mouth , to do duty for one . An old maid stood by the window : she had hung the cage with green chickweed ; and a little chaffinch hopped from perch to perch , and sang and twittered merrily enough . `` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing , '' said the Bottle-neck ; that is to say , it did not pronounce the words as we can speak them , for a bottle-neck ca n't speak ; but that 's what he thought to himself in his own mind , like when we people talk quietly to ourselves . `` Yes , it 's all very well for you to sing , you that have all your limbs uninjured . You ought to feel what it 's like to lose one 's body , and to have only mouth and neck left , and to be hampered with work into the bargain , as in my case ; and then I 'm sure you would not sing . But after all it is well that there should be somebody at least who is merry . I 've no reason to sing , and , moreover , I ca n't sing . Yes , when I was a whole bottle , I sung out well if they rubbed me with a cork . They used to call me a perfect lark , a magnificent lark ! Ah , when I was out at a picnic with the tanner 's family , and his daughter was betrothed ! Yes , I remember it as if it had happened only yesterday . I have gone through a great deal , when I come to recollect . I 've been in the fire and the water , have been deep in the black earth , and have mounted higher than most of the others ; and now I 'm hanging here , outside the birdcage , in the air and the sunshine ! Oh , it would be quite worth while to hear my history ; but I do n't speak aloud of it , because I ca n't . '' And now the Bottle-neck told its story , which was sufficiently remarkable . It told the story to itself , or only thought it in its own mind ; and the little bird sang his song merrily , and down in the street there was driving and hurrying , and every one thought of his own affairs , or perhaps of nothing at all ; and only the Bottle-neck thought . It thought of the flaming furnace in the manufactory , where it had been blown into life ; it still remembered that it had been quite warm , that it had glanced into the hissing furnace , the home of its origin , and had felt a great desire to leap directly back again ; but that gradually it had become cooler , and had been very comfortable in the place to which it was taken . It had stood in a rank with a whole regiment of brothers and sisters , all out of the same furnace ; some of them had certainly been blown into champagne bottles , and others into beer bottles , and that makes a difference . Later , out in the world , it may well happen that a beer bottle may contain the most precious wine , and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking ; but even in decay there is always something left by which people can see what one has been -- nobility is nobility , even when filled with blacking . All the bottles were packed up , and our bottle was among them . At that time it did not think to finish its career as a bottle-neck , or that it should work its way up to be a bird 's glass , which is always an honorable thing ; for one is of some consequence , after all . The bottle did not again behold the light of day till it was unpacked with the other bottles in the cellar of the wine merchant , and rinsed out for the first time ; and that was a strange sensation . There it lay , empty and without a cork , and felt strangely unwell , as if it wanted something , it could not tell what . At last it was filled with good costly wine , and was provided with a cork , and sealed down . A ticket was placed on it , marked `` first quality ; '' and it felt as if it had carried off the first prize at an examination ; for , you see , the wine was good and the bottle was good . When one is young , that 's the time for poetry ! There was a singing and sounding within it , of things which it could not understand -- of green sunny mountains , whereon the grape grows , where many vine dressers , men and women , sing and dance and rejoice . `` Ah , how beautiful is life ! '' There was a singing and sounding to all this in the bottle , as in a young poet 's brain ; and many a young poet does not understand the meaning of the song that is within him . One morning the bottle was bought , for the tanner 's apprentice was dispatched for a bottle of wine -- `` of the best . '' And now it was put in the provision basket , with ham and cheese and sausages ; the finest butter and the best bread were put into the basket too , the tanner 's daughter herself packed it . She was young and pretty ; her brown eyes laughed , and round her mouth played a smile as elegant as that in her eyes . She had delicate hands , beautifully white , and her neck was whiter still ; you saw at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls in the town : and still she was not engaged . The provision basket was in the lap of the young girl when the family drove out into the forest . The bottle-neck looked out from the folds of the white napkin . There was red wax upon the cork , and the bottle looked straight into the girl 's face . It also looked at the young sailor who sat next to the girl . He was a friend of old days , the son of the portrait painter . Quite lately he had passed with honor through his examination as mate , and to-morrow he was to sail away in a ship , far off to a distant land . There had been much talk of this while the basket was being packed ; and certainly the eyes and mouth of the tanner 's pretty daughter did not wear a very joyous expression just then . The young people sauntered through the green wood , and talked to one another . What were they talking of ? No , the bottle could not hear that , for it was in the provision basket . A long time passed before it was drawn forth ; but when that happened , there had been pleasant things going on , for all were laughing , and the tanner 's daughter laughed too ; but she spoke less than before , and her cheeks glowed like two roses . The father took the full bottle and the corkscrew in his hand . Yes , it 's a strange thing to be drawn thus , the first time ! The bottle-neck could never afterwards forget that impressive moment ; and indeed there was quite a convulsion within him when the cork flew out , and a great throbbing as the wine poured forth into the glasses . `` Health to the betrothed pair ! '' cried the papa ; and every glass was emptied to the dregs , and the young mate kissed his beautiful bride . `` Happiness and blessing ! '' said the two old people , the father and mother ; and the young man filled the glasses again . `` Safe return , and a wedding this day next year ! '' he cried ; and when the glasses were emptied , he took the bottle , raised it on high , and said , `` Thou hast been present at the happiest day of my life , thou shalt never serve another ! '' And so saying he hurled it high into the air . The tanner 's daughter did not then think that she should see the bottle fly again ; and yet it was to be so . It then fell into the thick reeds on the margin of a little woodland lake ; and the bottle-neck could remember quite plainly how it lay there for some time . `` I gave them wine , and they gave me marsh-water , '' he said ; `` but it was all meant for the best . '' He could no longer see the betrothed couple and the cheerful old people ; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing . Then at last came two peasant boys , and looked into the reeds ; they spied out the bottle , and took it up ; and now it was provided for . At their home , in the wood cottage , the eldest of these brothers , who was a sailor , and about to start on a long voyage , had been the day before to take leave : the mother was just engaged packing up various things he was to take with him on his journey , and which the father was going to carry into the town that evening to see his son once more , and to give him a farewell greeting for the lad 's mother and himself . A little bottle of medicated brandy had already been wrapped up in a parcel , when the boys came in with a larger and stronger bottle which they had found . This bottle would hold more than the little one , and they pronounced that the brandy would be capital for a bad digestion , inasmuch as it was mixed with medical herbs . The draught that was now poured into the bottle was not so good as the red wine with which it had once been filled ; these were bitter drops , but even these are sometimes good . The new big bottle was to go , and not the little one ; and so the bottle went traveling again . It was taken on board for Peter Jensen , in the very same ship in which the young mate sailed . But he did not see the bottle ; and , indeed , he would not have known it , or thought it was the same one out of which they had drunk a health to the betrothed pair , and to his own happy return . -LRB- Illustration : THE BOTTLE IS PRESENT ON A JOYOUS OCCASION . aaaaa -RRB- aaa Certainly it had no longer wine to give , but still it contained something that was just as good . Accordingly , whenever Peter Jensen brought it out , it was dubbed by his messmates The Apothecary . It contained the best medicine , medicine that strengthened the weak , and it gave liberally so long as it had a drop left . That was a pleasant time , and the bottle sang when it was rubbed with the cork ; and it was called the Great Lark , `` Peter Jensen 's Lark . '' Long days and months rolled on , and the bottle already stood empty in a corner , when it happened -- whether on the passage out or home the bottle could not tell , for it had never been ashore -- that a storm arose ; great waves came careering along , darkly and heavily , and lifted and tossed the ship to and fro . The mainmast was shivered , and a wave started one of the planks , and the pumps became useless . It was black night . The ship sank ; but at the last moment the young mate wrote on a leaf of paper , `` God 's will be done ! We are sinking ! '' He wrote the name of his betrothed , and his own name , and that of the ship , and put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened to be at hand : he corked it firmly down , and threw it out into the foaming sea . He knew not that it was the very bottle from which the goblet of joy and hope had once been filled for him ; and now it was tossing on the waves with his last greeting and the message of death . The ship sank , and the crew sank with her . The bottle sped on like a bird , for it bore a heart , a loving letter , within itself . And the sun rose and set ; and the bottle felt as at the time when it first came into being in the red gleaming oven -- it felt a strong desire to leap back into the light . It experienced calms and fresh storms ; but it was hurled against no rock , and was devoured by no shark ; and thus it drifted on for a year and a day , sometimes towards the north , sometimes towards the south , just as the current carried it . Beyond this it was its own master , but one may grow tired even of that . The written page , the last farewell of the bridegroom to his betrothed , would only bring sorrow if it came into her hands ; but where were the hands , so white and delicate , which had once spread the cloth on the fresh grass in the greenwood , on the betrothal day ? Where was the tanner 's daughter ? Yes , where was the land , and which land might be nearest to her dwelling ? The bottle knew not ; it drove onward and onward , and was at last tired of wandering , because that was not in its way ; but yet it had to travel until at last it came to land -- to a strange land . It understood not a word of what was spoken here , for this was not the language it had heard spoken before ; and one loses a good deal if one does not understand the language . The bottle was fished out and examined on all sides . The leaf of paper within it was discovered , and taken out , and turned over and over , but the people did not understand what was written thereon . They saw that the bottle must have been thrown overboard , and that something about this was written on the paper , but what were the words ? That question remained unanswered , and the paper was put back into the bottle , and the latter was deposited in a great cupboard , in a great room , in a great house . Whenever strangers came the paper was brought out , and turned over and over , so that the inscription , which was only written in pencil , became more and more illegible , so that at last no one could see that there were letters on it . And for a whole year more the bottle remained standing in the cupboard ; and then it was put into the loft , where it became covered with dust and cobwebs . Ah , how often it thought of the better days , the times when it had poured forth red wine in the greenwood , when it had been rocked on the waves of the sea , and when it had carried a secret , a letter , a parting sigh , safely enclosed in its bosom . For full twenty years it stood up in the loft ; and it might have remained there longer , but that the house was to be rebuilt . The roof was taken off , and then the bottle was noticed , and they spoke about it , but it did not understand their language ; for one can not learn a language by being shut up in a loft , even if one stays there for twenty years . `` If I had been down in the room , '' thought the Bottle , `` I might have learned it . '' It was now washed and rinsed , and indeed this was requisite . It felt quite transparent and fresh , and as if its youth had been renewed in this its old age ; but the paper it had carried so faithfully had been destroyed in the washing . The bottle was filled with seeds , though it scarcely knew what they were . It was corked , and well wrapped up . No light nor lantern was it vouchsafed to behold , much less the sun or the moon ; and yet , it thought , when one goes on a journey one ought to see something ; but though it saw nothing , it did what was most important -- it traveled to the place of its destination , and was there unpacked . `` What trouble they have taken over yonder with that bottle ! '' it heard people say ; `` and yet it is most likely broken . '' But it was not broken . The bottle understood every word that was now said ; this was the language it had heard at the furnace , and at the wine merchant 's , and in the forest , and in the ship , the only good old language it understood : it had come back home , and the language was as a salutation of welcome to it . For very joy it felt ready to jump out of people 's hands ; hardly did it notice that its cork had been drawn , and that it had been emptied and carried into the cellar , to be placed there and forgotten . There 's no place like home , even if it 's in a cellar ! It never occurred to the bottle to think how long it would lie there , for it felt comfortable , and accordingly lay there for years . At last people came down into the cellar to carry off all the bottles , and ours among the rest . Out in the garden there was a great festival . Flaming lamps hung like garlands , and paper lanterns shone transparent , like great tulips . The evening was lovely , the weather still and clear , the stars twinkled ; it was the time of the new moon , but in reality the whole moon could be seen as a bluish gray disc with a golden rim round half its surface , which was a very beautiful sight for those who had good eyes . The illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden walks ; at least so much of it , that one could find one 's way there . Among the leaves of the hedges stood bottles , with a light in each ; and among them was also the bottle we know , and which was destined one day to finish its career as a bottle-neck , a bird 's drinking-glass . Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle , for it was once more in the greenwood , amid joy and feasting , and heard song and music , and the noise and murmur of a crowd , especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns displayed their many colors . Thus it stood , in a distant walk certainly , but that made it the more important ; for it bore its light , and was at once ornamental and useful , and that is as it should be : in such an hour one forgets twenty years spent in a loft , and it is right one should do so . There passed close to it a pair , like the pair who had walked together long ago in the wood , the sailor and the tanner 's daughter ; the bottle seemed to experience all that over again . In the garden were walking not only the guests , but other people who were allowed to view all the splendor ; and among these latter came an old maid who seemed to stand alone in the world . She was just thinking , like the bottle , of the greenwood , and of a young betrothed pair -- of a pair which concerned her very nearly , a pair in which she had an interest , and of which she had been a part , in that happiest hour of her life -- the hour one never forgets , if one should become ever so old a maid . But she did not know our bottle , nor did the bottle recognize the old maid : it is thus we pass each other in the world , meeting again and again , as these two met , now that they were together again in the same town . From the garden the bottle was dispatched once more to the wine merchant 's , where it was filled with wine , and sold to the aeronaut , who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following Sunday . A great crowd had assembled to witness the sight ; military music had been provided , and many other preparations had been made . The bottle saw everything , from a basket in which it lay next to a live rabbit , which latter was quite bewildered because he knew he was to be taken up into the air , and let down again in a parachute ; but the bottle knew nothing of the `` up '' or the `` down ; '' it only saw the balloon swelling up bigger and bigger , and at last , when it could swell no more , beginning to rise , and to grow more and more restless . The ropes that held it were cut , and the huge machine floated aloft with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit , and the music sounded , and all the people cried , `` Hurrah ! '' `` This is a wonderful passage , up into the air ! '' thought the Bottle ; `` this is a new way of sailing ; at any rate , up here we can not strike upon anything . '' Thousands of people gazed up at the balloon , and the old maid looked up at it also ; she stood at the open window of the garret , in which hung the cage with the little chaffinch , who had no water-glass as yet , but was obliged to be content with an old cup . In the window stood a myrtle in a pot ; and it had been put a little aside that it might not fall out , for the old maid was leaning out of the window to look , and she distinctly saw the aeronaut in the balloon , and how he let down the rabbit in the parachute , and then drank to the health of all the spectators , and at length hurled the bottle high in the air ; she never thought that this was the identical bottle which she had already once seen thrown aloft in honor of her and of her friend on the day of rejoicing in the greenwood , in the time of her youth . The bottle had no respite for thought ; for it was quite startled at thus suddenly reaching the highest point in its career . Steeples and roofs lay far , far beneath , and the people looked like mites . But now it began to descend with a much more rapid fall than that of the rabbit ; the bottle threw somersaults in the air , and felt quite young , and quite free and unfettered ; and yet it was half full of wine , though it did not remain so long . What a journey ! The sun shone on the bottle , all the people were looking at it , the balloon was already far away , and soon the bottle was far away too ; for it fell upon a roof and broke ; but the pieces had got such an impetus that they could not stop themselves , but went jumping and rolling on till they came down into the courtyard and lay there in smaller pieces yet ; the bottle-neck only managed to keep whole , and that was cut off as clean as if it had been done with a diamond . `` That would do capitally for a bird-glass , '' said the cellarmen ; but they had neither a bird nor a cage ; and to expect them to provide both because they had found a bottle-neck that might be made available for a glass , would have been expecting too much ; but the old maid in the garret , perhaps it might be useful to her ; and now the bottle-neck was taken up to her , and was provided with a cork . The part that had been uppermost was now turned downwards , as often happens when changes take place ; fresh water was poured into it , and it was fastened to the cage of the little bird , which sung and twittered right merrily . `` Yes , it 's very well for you to sing , '' said the Bottle-neck ; and it was considered remarkable for having been in the balloon -- for that was all they knew of its history . Now it hung there as a bird-glass , and heard the murmuring and noise of the people in the street below , and also the words of the old maid in the room within . An old friend had just come to visit her , and they talked -- not of the bottle-neck , but about the myrtle in the window . `` No , you certainly must not spend a dollar for your daughter 's bridal wreath , '' said the old maid . `` You shall have a beautiful little nosegay from me , full of blossoms . Do you see how splendidly that tree has come on ? yes , that has been raised from a spray of the myrtle you gave me on the day after my betrothal , and from which I was to have made my own wreath when the year was past ; but that day never came ! The eyes closed that were to have been my joy and delight through life . In the depths of the sea he sleeps sweetly , my dear one ! The myrtle has become an old tree , and I become a yet older woman ; and when it faded at last , I took the last green shoot , and planted it in the ground , and it has become a great tree ; and now at length the myrtle will serve at the wedding -- as a wreath for your daughter . '' There were tears in the eyes of the old maid . She spoke of the beloved of her youth , of their betrothal in the wood ; many thoughts came to her , but the thought never came , that quite close to her , before the very window , was a remembrance of those times ; the neck of the bottle which had shouted for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day . But the bottle-neck did not recognize her , for he was not listening to what this old maid said -- and still that was because he was thinking of her .
