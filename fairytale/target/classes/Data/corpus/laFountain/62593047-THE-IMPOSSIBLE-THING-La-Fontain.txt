A DEMON , blacker in his skin than heart , So great a charm was prompted to impart ; To one in love , that he the lady gained , And full possession in the end obtained : The bargain was , the lover should enjoy The belle he wished , and who had proved so coy . Said Satan , soon I 'll make her lend an ear , In ev ` ry thing more complaisant appear ; But then , instead of what thou might ` st expect , To be obedient and let me direct , The devil , having thus obliged a friend , He 'll thy commands obey , thou may ` st depend , The very moment ; and within the hour Thy humble servant , who has got such pow ` r , Will ask for others , which at once thou ` lt find ; Make no delay , for if thou art so blind , Thou comprehend ` st , thy body and thy soul The lovely fair no longer shall control , But Satan then upon them both shall seize , And with them do-whatever he may please : ` Gainst this the spark had not a word to say ; 'Twas pleasing to command , though not obey . HE sallied forth the beauteous belle to seek , And found her as he wished : -- complying-meek ; Indulged in blisses , and most happy proved , Save that the devil always round him moved . Whatever rose within the whirl of thought He now commanded : -- quickly it was brought ; And when he ordered palaces to rise , Or raging tempests to pervade the skies , The devil instantly obeyed his will , And what he asked was done with wondrous skill . LARGE sums his purse received ; -- the devil went just where commanded , and to Rome was sent , From whence his highness store of pardons got ; No journey long , though distant was the spot , But ev ` ry thing with magick ease arose , And all was soon accomplished that he chose . So oft the spark was asked for orders new , Which he was bound to give the fiend at view , That soon his head most thoroughly was drained , And to the fair our lover much complained , Declared the truth , and ev ` ry thing detailed , How he was lost , if in commands he failed . IS ` T this , said she , that makes thee so forlorn ? Mere nothing ! - quickly I 'll remove the thorn ; When Satan comes , present his highness this , Which I have here , and say : -- You will not miss To make it flat , and not its curl retain On which she gave him , what with little pain She drew from covert of the Cyprian grove , The fairy labyrinth where pleasures rove , Which formerly a duke so precious thought ; To raise a knightly order thence he sought , Illustrious institution , noble plan , More filled with gods and demi-gods than man . THE lover to the crafty devil said : -- ` Tis crooked this , you see , and I am led To wish it otherwise ; go , make it straight ; A perfect line : no turn , nor twist , nor plait . Away to work , be quick , fly , hasten , run ; The demon fancied it could soon be done ; No time he lost , but set it in the press , And tried to manage it with great success ; The massy hammer , kept beneath the deep , Made no impression : he as well might sleep ; Howe'er he beat : whatever charm he used : -- 'Twas still the same ; obedience it refused . His time and labor constantly were lost ; Vain proved each effort : mystick skill was crossed ; The wind , or rain , or fog , or frost , or snow , Had no effect : still circular ` twould go . The more he tried , the ringlet less inclined To drop the curvature so closely twined . How 's this ? said Satan , never have I seen Such stubborn stuff wherever I have been ; The shades below no demon can produce , That could divine what here would prove of use : ` Twould puzzle hell to break the curling spring , And make a line direct of such a thing . ONE morn the devil to the other went : Said he , to give thee up I 'll be content ; If solely thou wilt openly declare What ` tis I hold , for truly I despair ; I 'm victus I confess , and ca n't succeed : No doubt the thing 's impossible decreed . FRIEND Satan , said the lover , you are wrong ; Despondency should not to you belong , At least so soon : -- what you desire to know Is not the only one that 's found to grow ; Still many more companions it has got , And others could be taken from the spot .
