I was scarcely past my infancy when the king my father perceived that I was endowed with a great deal of sense , and spared nothing in improving it ; he employed all the men in his dominions that excelled in science and art to be constantly about me . No sooner was I able to read and write than I learned the Koran from the beginning to the end by heart ; that admirable book which contains the foundation , the precepts , and the rules of our religion ; and that I might be thoroughly instructed in it , I read the works of the most approved authors , by whose commentaries it had been explained . I added to this study that of all the traditions collected from the mouth of our Prophet by the great men that were contemporary with him . I was not satisfied with the knowledge of all that had any relation to our religion , but made also a particular search into our histories . I made myself perfect in polite learning , in the works of poets , and in versification . I applied myself to geography , chronology , and to speak our Arabic tongue in its purity . But one thing which I was fond of and succeeded in to a special degree was to form the characters of our written language , wherein I surpassed all the writing masters of our kingdom that had acquired the greatest reputation . Fame did me more honor than I deserved , for she not only spread the renown of my talents through all the dominions of the king my father , but carried it as far as the Indian court , whose potent monarch , desirous to see me , sent an ambassador with rich presents to demand me of my father , who was extremely glad of this embassy for several reasons ; he was persuaded that nothing could be more commendable in a prince of my age than to travel and visit foreign courts , and he was very glad to gain the friendship of the Indian sultan . I departed with the ambassador , but with no great retinue , because of the length and difficulty of the journey . When we had traveled about a month , we discovered at a distance a great cloud of dust , and under that we very soon saw fifty horsemen , well armed , that were robbers , coming towards us at full gallop . As we had ten horses laden with baggage and presents that I was to carry to the Indian sultan from the king my father , and my retinue was but small , these robbers came boldly up to us . Not being in a position to make any resistance , we told them that we were ambassadors belonging to the Sultan of the Indies , and hoped they would attempt nothing contrary to that respect which is due to him , thinking by this means to save our equipage and our lives . But the robbers most insolently replied , ` For what reason would you have us show any respect to the sultan your master ? We are none of his subjects , nor are we upon his territories . ' Having spoken thus , they surrounded and fell upon us . I defended myself as long as I could , but finding myself wounded , and seeing the ambassador with his servants and mine lying on the ground , I made use of what strength was yet remaining in my horse , who was also very much wounded , separated myself from the crowd , and rode away as fast as he could carry me ; but he happened all of a sudden to give way under me , through weariness and loss of blood , and fell down dead . I got rid of him in a trice , and finding that I was not pursued , it made me judge that the robbers were not willing to quit the booty they had got . Here you see me alone , wounded , destitute of help , and in a strange country : I durst not betake myself to the high road , lest I might fall again into the hands of these robbers . When I had bound up my wound , which was not dangerous , I walked on for the rest of the day , and arrived at the foot of a mountain , where I perceived a passage into a cave : I went in , and stayed there that night with little satisfaction , after I had eaten some fruits that I gathered by the way . I continued my journey for several days without finding any place of abode ; but after a month 's time , I came to a large town , well inhabited , and situated so advantageously , as it was surrounded with several rivers , that it enjoyed perpetual spring . The pleasant objects which then presented themselves to my eyes afforded me joy , and suspended for a time the sorrow with which I was overwhelmed to find myself in such a condition . My face , hands and feet were black and sunburnt ; and , owing to my long journey , my shoes and stockings were quite worn out , so that I was forced to walk bare-footed , and , besides , my clothes were all in rags . I entered into the town to learn where I was , and addressed myself to a tailor that was at work in his shop ; who , perceiving by my air that I was a person of more note than my outward appearance bespoke me to be , made me sit down by him , and asked me who I was , from whence I came , and what had brought me thither ? I did not conceal anything that had befallen me . The tailor listened with attention to my words ; but after I had done speaking , instead of giving me any consolation , he augmented my sorrow . ` Take heed , ' said he , ` how you discover to any person what you have now declared to me ; for the prince of this country is the greatest enemy that the king your father has , and he will certainly do you some mischief when he comes to hear of your being in this city . ' I made no doubt of the tailor 's sincerity , when he named the prince , and returned him thanks for his good advice : and as he believed I could not but be hungry , he ordered something to be brought for me to eat , and offered me at the same time a lodging in his house , which I accepted . Some days after , finding me pretty well recovered from the fatigue I had endured by a long and tedious journey , and reflecting that most princes of our religion applied themselves to some art or calling that might be serviceable to them upon occasion , he asked me if I had learned anything whereby I might get a livelihood , and not be burdensome to any one ? I told him that I understood the laws , both divine and human ; that I was a grammarian and poet ; and , above all , that I understood writing perfectly . ` By all this , ' said he , ` you will not be able , in this country , to purchase yourself one morsel of bread ; nothing is of less use here than those sciences : but if you will be advised by me , ' said he , ` dress yourself in a labourer 's frock ; and since you appear to be strong and of a good constitution , you shall go into the next forest and cut fire-wood , which you may bring to the market to be sold ; and I can assure you it will turn to such good account that you may live by it , without dependence upon any man : and by this means you will be in a condition to wait for the favourable moment when Heaven shall think fit to dispel those clouds of misfortune that thwart your happiness , and oblige you to conceal your birth . I will take care to supply you with a rope and a hatchet . ' The fear of being known , and the necessity I was under of getting a livelihood , made me agree to this proposal , notwithstanding all the hardships that attended it . The day following the tailor bought me a rope , a hatchet , and a short coat , and recommended me to some poor people who gained their bread after the same manner , that they might take me into their company . They conducted me to the wood , and the first day I brought in as much upon my head as earned me half a piece of gold , which is the money of that country ; for though the wood is not far distant from the town , yet it was very scarce there , for few or none would be at the trouble to go and cut it . I gained a good sum of money in a short time , and repaid my tailor what he had advanced for me . I continued this way of living for a whole year ; and one day , when by chance I had gone farther into the wood than usual , I happened to light on a very pleasant place , where I began to cut down wood ; and in pulling up the root of a tree , I espied an iron ring , fastened to a trap-door of the same metal . I took away the earth that covered it , and having lifted it up , saw stairs , down which I went , with my axe in my hand . When I came to the bottom of the stairs , I found myself in a large palace , which put me into great consternation , because of a great light which appeared as clear in it as if it had been above ground in the open air . I went forward along a gallery supported by pillars of jasper , the base and capitals of massy gold ; but seeing a lady of a noble and free air and extremely beautiful coming towards me , my eyes were taken off from beholding any other object but her alone . Being desirous to spare the lady the trouble of coming to me , I made haste to meet her ; and as I was saluting her with a low bow , she asked me , ` What are you , a man or a genie ? ' ` A man , madam , ' said I : ` I have no correspondence with genies . ' ` By what adventure , ' said she , fetching a deep sigh , ` are you come hither ? I have lived here these twenty-five years , and never saw any man but yourself during that time . ' Her great beauty , and the sweetness and civility wherewith she received me , emboldened me to say to her , ` Madam , before I have the honor to satisfy your curiosity , give me leave to tell you that I am infinitely pleased with this unexpected meeting , which offers me an occasion of consolation in the midst of my affliction ; and perhaps it may give me an opportunity to make you also more happy than you are . ' I gave her a true account by what strange accident she saw me , the son of a king , in such a condition as I then presented to her eyes ; and how fortune directed that I should discover the entrance into that magnificent prison where I had found her according to appearances in an unpleasant situation . ` Alas ! prince , ' said she , sighing once more , ` you have just cause to believe this rich and pompous prison can not be otherwise than a most wearisome abode ; the most charming place in the world being no way delightful when we are detained there contrary to our will . You have heard of the great Epitimarus , King of the Isle of Ebony , so called from that precious wood , which it produces in abundance : I am the princess his daughter . ` The king , my father , had chosen for me a husband , a prince that was my cousin ; but in the midst of the rejoicing at the court , before I was given to my husband , a genie took me away . I fainted at the same moment , and lost my senses ; and when I came to myself again , I found myself in this place . I was for a long time inconsolable , but time and necessity have accustomed me to the genie . Twenty-five years , as I told you before , I have continued in this place ; where , I must confess , I have everything that I can wish for necessary to life , and also everything that can satisfy a princess fond of dress and fashions . ` Every ten days , ' continued the princess , ` the genie comes hither to see me . Meanwhile , if I have occasion for him by day or night , as soon as I touch a talisman which is at the entrance into my chamber , the genie appears . It is now the fourth day since he was here , and I do not expect him before the end of six more ; so , if you please , you may stay five days and keep me company , and I will endeavor to entertain you according to your rank and merit . ' I thought myself too fortunate in having obtained so great a favor without asking it to refuse so obliging an offer . The princess made me go into a bath , which was the most sumptuous that could be imagined ; and when I came forth , instead of my own clothes , I found another very costly suit , which I did not esteem so much for its richness as because it made me look worthy to be in her company . We sat down on a sofa covered with rich tapestry , with cushions to lean upon of the rarest Indian brocade ; and soon after she covered a table with several dishes of delicate meats . We ate together , and passed the remaining part of the day with much satisfaction . The next day , as she contrived every means to please me , she brought in , at dinner , a bottle of old wine , the most excellent that ever was tasted ; and out of complaisance she drank some part of it with me . When my head grew hot with the agreeable liquor , ` Fair princess , ' said I , ` you have been too long thus buried alive : follow me , and enjoy the real day , from which you have been deprived so many years , and abandon this false light that you have here . ' ` Prince , ' replied she , with a smile , ` stop this discourse ; if out of ten days you will grant me nine , and resign the last to the genie , the fairest day that ever was would be nothing in my esteem . ' ` Princess , ' said I , ` it is the fear of the genie that makes you speak thus ; for my part , I value him so little that I will break his talisman in pieces . Let him come , I will expect him ; and how brave or redoubtable soever he be , I will make him feel the weight of my arm : I swear , solemnly that I will extirpate all the genies in the world , and him first . ' The princess , who knew the consequences , conjured me not to touch the talisman ; ` for that would be a means , ' said she , ` to ruin both you and me : I know what belongs to genies better than you . ' The fumes of the wine did not suffer me to hearken to her reasons ; but I gave the talisman a kick with my foot , and broke it in several pieces . The talisman was no sooner broken , than the palace began to shake , and was ready to fall with a hideous noise like thunder , accompanied with flashes of lightning and a great darkness . This terrible noise in a moment dispelled the fumes of my wine , and made me sensible , but too late , of the folly I had committed . ` Princess , ' cried I , ` what means all this ? ' She answered in a fright , and without any concern for her own misfortune , ` Alas ! you are undone , if you do not escape immediately . ' I followed her advice , and my fears were so great that I forgot my hatchet and cords . I had scarcely got to the stairs by which I came down , when the enchanted palace opened , and made a passage for the genie : he asked the princess , in great anger , ` What has happened to you , and why did you call me ? ' ` A qualm , ' said the princess , ` made me fetch this bottle which you see here , out of which I drank twice or thrice , and by mischance made a false step , and fell upon the talisman , which is broken , and that is all . ' At this answer the furious genie told her , ` You are a false woman , and a liar : how came that axe and those cords there ? ' ` I never saw them till this moment , ' said the princess . ` Your coming in such an impetuous manner has , it may be , forced them up in some place as you came along , and so brought them hither without your knowing it . ' The genie made no other answer but reproaches and blows of which I heard the noise . I could not endure to hear the pitiful cries and shouts of the princess , so cruelly abused ; I had already laid off the suit she made me put on , and taken my own , which I had laid on the stairs the day before , when I came out of the bath ; I made haste upstairs , distracted with sorrow and compassion , as I had been the cause of so great a misfortune . For by sacrificing the fairest princess on earth to the barbarity of a merciless genie , I was become the most criminal and ungrateful of mankind . ` It is true , ' said I , ` she has been a prisoner these twenty-five years ; but , liberty excepted , she wanted nothing that could make her happy . My folly has put an end to her happiness , and brought upon her the cruelty of an unmerciful monster . ' I let down the trap - door , covered it again with earth , and returned to the city with a burden of wood , which I bound up without knowing what I did , so great was my trouble and sorrow . My landlord , the tailor , was very much rejoiced to see me . ` Your absence , ' said he , ` has disquieted me very much , because you had entrusted me with the secret of your birth , and I knew not what to think ; I was afraid somebody had discovered you : God be thanked for your return . ' I thanked him for his zeal and affection , but not a word durst I say of what had passed , nor the reason why I came back without my hatchet and cords . I retired to my chamber , where I reproached myself a thousand times for my excessive imprudence . ` Nothing , ' said I , ` could have paralleled the princess 's good fortune and mine had I forborne to break the talisman . ' While I was thus giving myself over to melancholy thoughts , the tailor came in . ` An old man , ' said he , ` whom I do not know , brings me here your hatchet and cords , which he found in his way , as he tells me , and understood from your comrades that you lodge here ; come out and speak to him , for he will deliver them to none but yourself . ' At this discourse I changed color , and began to tremble . While the tailor was asking me the reason , my chamber door opened , and the old man appeared to us with my hatchet and cords . This was the genie , the ravisher of the fair princess of the Isle of Ebony , who had thus disguised himself , after he had treated her with the utmost barbarity . ` I am a genie , ' said he , ` son of the daughter of Eblis , prince of genies . Is not this your hatchet , and are not these your cords ? ' After the genie had put the question to me , he gave me no time to answer , nor was it in my power , so much had his terrible aspect disordered me . He grasped me by the middle , dragged me out of the chamber , and mounting into the air , carried me up to the skies with such swiftness that I was unable to take notice of the way he carried me . He descended again in like manner to the earth , which on a sudden he caused to open with a stroke of his foot , and so sank down at once , where I found myself in the enchanted palace , before the fair princess of the Isle of Ebony . But alas , what a spectacle was there ! I saw what pierced me to the heart ; this poor princess was weltering in her blood upon the ground , more dead than alive , with her cheeks bathed in tears . ` Perfidious wretch , ' said the genie to her ; pointing at me , ` who is this ? ' She cast her languishing eyes upon me , and answered mournfully , ' I do not know him ; I never saw him till this moment . ' ` What ! ' said the genie , ` he is the cause of thy being in the condition thou art justly in , and yet darest thou say thou dost not know him ? ' ` If I do not know him , ' said the princess , ` would you have me tell a lie on purpose to ruin him ? ' ` Oh then , ' continued the genie , pulling out a scimitar , and presenting it to the princess , ` if you never saw him before , take the scimitar and cut off his head . ' ` Alas ! ' replied the princess , ` my strength is so far spent that I can not lift up my arm , and if I could , how should I have the heart to take away the life of an innocent man ? ' ` This refusal , ' said the genie to the princess , ` sufficiently informs me of your crime . ' Upon which , turning to me , ` And thou , ' said he , ` dost thou not know her ? ' I should have been the most ungrateful wretch , and the most perfidious of all mankind , if I had not shown myself as faithful to the princess as she was to me who had been the cause of her misfortunes ; therefore I answered the genie , ` How should I know her ? ' ` If it be so , ' said he , ` take the scimitar and cut off her head : on this condition I will set thee at liberty , for then I shall be convinced that thou didst never see her till this very moment , as thou sayest . ' ` With all my heart , ' replied I , and took the scimitar in my hand . But I did it only to demonstrate by my behavior , as much as possible , that as she had shown her resolution to sacrifice her life for my sake , I would not refuse to sacrifice mine for hers . The princess , notwithstanding her pain and suffering , understood my meaning , which she signified by an obliging look . Upon this I stepped back , and threw the scimitar on the ground . ` I should for ever , ' said I to the genie , ` be hateful to all mankind were I to be so base as to murder a lady like this , who is ready to give up the ghost : do with me what you please , since I am in your power ; I can not obey your barbarous commands . ' ` I see , ' said the genie , ` that you both outbrave me , but both of you shall know , by the treatment I give you , what I am capable of doing . ' At these words the monster took up the scimitar and cut off one of her hands , which left her only so much life as to give me a token with the other that she bid me adieu for ever , the sight of which threw me into a fit . When I was come to myself again , I expostulated with the genie as to why he made me languish in expectation of death . ` Strike , ' cried I , ` for I am ready to receive the mortal blow , and expect it as the greatest favor you can show me . ' But instead of agreeing to that , ` Look you , ' said he , ` how genies treat their wives whom they suspect : she has received you here , and were I certain that she had put any further affront upon me , I would put you to death this minute : but I will be content to transform you into a dog , ape , lion , or bird . Take your choice of any of these ; I will leave it to yourself . ' These words gave me some hope to mollify him . ` Oh genie , ' said I , ` moderate your passion , and since you will not take away my life , give it me generously ; I shall always remember you , if you pardon me , as one of the best men in the world . ' ` All that I can do for you , ' said he , ` is , not to take your life : do not flatter yourself that I will send you back safe and sound ; I must let you feel what I am able to do by my enchantments . ' So saying , he laid violent hands on me , and carried me across the vault of the subterranean palace , which opened to give him passage . Then he flew up with me so high that the earth seemed to be only a little white cloud ; from thence he came down like lightning , and alighted upon the ridge of a mountain . There he took up a handful of earth , and pronounced , or rather muttered , some words which I did not understand , and threw it upon me . ` Quit the shape of a man , ' said he to me , ` and take on you that of an ape . ' He vanished immediately , and left me alone , transformed into an ape , overwhelmed with sorrow in a strange country , and not knowing whether I was near or far from my father 's dominions . I went down from the top of the mountain and came into a plain , which took me a month 's time to travel through , and then I came to the seaside . It happened to be then a great calm , and I espied a vessel about half a league from the shore . Unwilling to lose this good opportunity , I broke off a large branch from a tree , which I carried with me to the seaside , and set myself astride upon it , with a stick in each hand to serve me for oars . I launched out in this posture , and advanced near the ship . When I was near enough to be known , the seamen and passengers that were upon the deck thought it an extraordinary sight , and all of them looked upon me with great astonishment . In the meantime I got aboard , and laying hold of a rope , I jumped upon the deck , but having lost my speech , I found myself in great perplexity ; and indeed the risk I ran then was nothing less than when I was at the mercy of the genie . The merchants , being both superstitious and scrupulous , believed I should occasion some mischief to their voyage if they received me ; ` therefore , ' said one , ` I will knock him down with a handspike ' ; said another , ` I will shoot an arrow through him ' ; said a third , ` Let us throw him into the sea . ' Some of them would not have failed to do so , if I had not got to that side where the captain was . I threw myself at his feet , and took him by the coat in a begging posture . This action , together with the tears which he saw gush from my eyes , moved his compassion ; so that he took me under his protection , threatening to be revenged on him that would do me the least hurt ; and he himself made very much of me , while I on my part , though I had no power to speak , showed all possible signs of gratitude by my gestures . The wind that succeeded the calm was gentle and favourable , and did not change for fifty days , but brought us safe to the port of a fine city , well peopled , and of great trade , the capital of a powerful State , where we came to anchor . Our vessel was speedily surrounded with an infinite number of boats full of people , who came to congratulate their friends upon their safe arrival , or to inquire for those they had left behind them in the country from whence they came , or out of curiosity to see a ship that came from a far country . Amongst the rest , some officers came on board , desiring to speak with the merchants in the name of the sultan . The merchants appearing , one of the officers told them , ` The sultan , our master , hath commanded us to acquaint you that he is glad of your safe arrival , and prays you to take the trouble , every one of you , to write some lines upon this roll of paper . You must know that we had a prime vizier who , besides having a great capacity to manage affairs , understood writing to the highest perfection . This minister is lately dead , at which the sultan is very much troubled ; and since he can never behold his writing without admiration , he has made a solemn vow not to give the place to any man but to him who can write as well as he did . Many people have presented their writings , but , so far , nobody in all this empire has been judged worthy to supply the vizier 's place . ' Those merchants that believed they could write well enough to aspire to this high dignity wrote one after another what they thought fit . After they had done , I advanced , and took the roll out of the gentleman 's hand ; but all the people , especially the merchants , cried out , ` He will tear it , or throw it into the sea , ' till they saw how properly I held the roll , and made a sign that I would write in my turn ; then they were of another opinion , and their fear turned into admiration . However , since they had never seen an ape that could write , nor could be persuaded that I was more ingenious than other apes , they tried to snatch the roll out of my hand ; but the captain took my part once more . ` Let him alone , ' said he ; ` suffer him to write . If he only scribbles the paper , I promise you that I will punish him on the spot . If , on the contrary , he writes well , as I hope he will , because I never saw an ape so clever and ingenious and so quick of apprehension , I do declare that I will own him as my son ; I had one that had not half the wit that he has . ' Perceiving that nobody opposed my design , I took the pen and wrote six sorts of hands used among the Arabians , and each specimen contained an extemporary verse or poem in praise of the sultan . My writing did not only excel that of the merchants , but , I venture to say , they had not before seen any such fair writing in that country . When I had done , the officers took the roll , and carried it to the sultan . The sultan took little notice of any of the other writings , but he carefully considered mine , which was so much to his liking that he said to the officers , ` Take the finest horse in my stable , with the richest harness , and a robe of the most sumptuous brocade to put upon that person who wrote the six hands , and bring him hither to me . ' At this command the officers could not forbear laughing . The sultan grew angry at their boldness , and was ready to punish them , till they told him , ` Sir , we humbly beg your majesty 's pardon ; these hands were not written by a man , but by an ape . ' ` What do you say ? ' said the sultan . ` Those admirable characters , are they not written by the hands of a man ? ' ` No , sir , ' replied the officers ; ` we do assure your majesty that it was an ape , who wrote them in our presence . ' The sultan was too much surprised at this not to desire a sight of me , and therefore said , ` Bring me speedily that wonderful ape . ' The officers returned to the vessel and showed the captain their order , who answered that the sultan 's commands must be obeyed . Whereupon they clothed me with that rich brocade robe and carried me ashore , where they set me on horseback , whilst the sultan waited for me at his palace with a great number of courtiers , whom he gathered together to do me the more honor . The cavalcade having begun , the harbor , the streets , the public places , windows , terraces , palaces , and houses were filled with an infinite number of people of all sorts , who flocked from all parts of the city to see me ; for the rumor was spread in a moment that the sultan had chosen an ape to be his grand vizier ; and after having served for a spectacle to the people , who could not forbear to express their surprise by redoubling their shouts and cries , I arrived at the palace of the sultan . I found the prince on his throne in the midst of the grandees ; I made my bow three times very low , and at last kneeled and kissed the ground before him , and afterwards sat down in the posture of an ape . The whole assembly admired me , and could not comprehend how it was possible that an ape should understand so well how to pay the sultan his due respect ; and he himself was more astonished than any one . In short , the usual ceremony of the audience would have been complete could I have added speech to my behavior : but apes never speak , and the advantage I had of having been a man did not allow me that privilege . The sultan dismissed his courtiers , and none remained by him but the chief of the chamberlains , a young slave , and myself . He went from his chamber of audience into his own apartment , where he ordered dinner to be brought . As he sat at table he gave me a sign to come near and eat with them : to show my obedience I kissed the ground , stood up , sat down at table , and ate with discretion and moderation . Before the table was uncovered , I espied a writing-desk , which I made a sign should be brought me : having got it , I wrote upon a large peach some verses after my way , which testified my acknowledgment to the sultan , which increased his astonishment . When the table was uncovered , they brought him a particular liquor , of which he caused them to give me a glass . I drank , and wrote upon it some new verses , which explained the state I was reduced to after many sufferings . The sultan read them likewise , and said , ' A man that was capable of doing so much would be above the greatest of men . ' The sultan caused them to bring in a chess-board , and asked me , by a sign , if I understood the game , and would play with him . I kissed the ground , and laying my hand upon my head , signified that I was ready to receive that honor . He won the first game , but I won the second and third ; and perceiving he was somewhat displeased at it , I made a poem to pacify him ; in which I told him that two potent armies had been fighting furiously all day , but that they made up a peace towards the evening , and passed the remaining part of the night very peaceably together upon the field of battle . So many circumstances appearing to the sultan far beyond whatever any one had either seen or known of the cleverness or sense of apes , he determined not to be the only witness of those prodigies himself ; but having a daughter , called the Lady of Beauty , on whom the chief of the chamberlains , then present , waited , ` Go , ' said the sultan to him , ` and bid your lady come hither : I am desirous she should share my pleasure . ' The chamberlain went , and immediately brought the princess , who had her face uncovered ; but she had no sooner come into the room than she put on her veil , and said to the sultan , ` Sir , your majesty must needs have forgotten yourself : I am very much surprised that your majesty has sent for me to appear among men . ' ` Nay , daughter , ' said the sultan , ` you do not know what you say : here is nobody but the little slave , the chamberlain your attendant and myself , who have the liberty to see your face ; and yet you lower your veil , and blame me for having sent for you hither . ' ` Sir , ' said the princess , ` your majesty shall soon understand that I am not in the wrong . That ape you see before you , though he has the shape of an ape , is a young prince , son of a great king ; he has been metamorphosed into an ape by enchantment . A genie , the son of the daughter of Eblis , has maliciously done him this wrong , after having cruelly taken away the life of the Princess of the Isle of Ebony , daughter to the King Epitimarus . ' The sultan , astonished at this discourse , turned towards me and asked no more by signs , but in plain words if it was true what his daughter said ? Seeing I could not speak , I put my hand to my head to signify that what the princess spoke was true . Upon this the sultan said again to his daughter , ` How do you know that this prince has been transformed by enchantments into an ape ? ' ` Sir , ' replied the Lady of Beauty , ` your majesty may remember that when I was past my infancy , I had an old lady to wait upon me ; she was a most expert magician , and taught me seventy rules of magic , by virtue of which I can transport your capital city into the midst of the sea in the twinkling of an eye , or beyond Mount Caucasus . By this science I know all enchanted persons at first sight . I know who they are , and by whom they have been enchanted . Therefore do not be surprised if I should forthwith relieve this prince , in spite of the enchantments , from that which hinders him from appearing in your sight what he naturally is . ' ` Daughter , ' said the sultan , ` I did not believe you to have understood so much . ' ` Sir , ' replied the princess , ` these things are curious and worth knowing , but I think I ought not to boast of them . ' ` Since it is so , ' said the sultan , ` you can dispel the prince 's enchantment . ' ` Yes , sir , ' said the princess , ` I can restore him to his first shape again . ' ` Do it then , ' said the sultan ; ` you can not do me a greater pleasure , for I will have him to be my vizier , and he shall marry you . ' ` Sir , ' said the princess , ` I am ready to obey you in all that you may be pleased to command me . ' The princess , the Lady of Beauty , went into her apartment , from whence she brought in a knife , which had some Hebrew words engraven on the blade ; she made the sultan , the master of the chamberlains , the little slave , and myself , go down into a private court of the palace , and there left us under a gallery that went round it . She placed herself in the middle of the court , where she made a great circle , and within it she wrote several words in Arabic characters , some of them ancient , and others of those which they call the characters of Cleopatra . When she had finished and prepared the circle as she thought fit , she placed herself in the center of it , where she began spells , and repeated verses out of the Koran . The air grew insensibly dark , as if it had been night and the whole world about to be dissolved ; we found ourselves struck with a panic , and this fear increased the more when we saw the genie , the son of the daughter of Eblis , appear on a sudden in the shape of a lion of a frightful size . As soon as the princess perceived this monster , ` You dog , ' said she , ` instead of creeping before me , dare you present yourself in this shape , thinking to frighten me ? ' ` And thou , ' replied the lion , ` art thou not afraid to break the treaty which was solemnly made and confirmed between us by oath , not to wrong or to do one another any hurt ? ' ` Oh ! thou cursed creature ! ' replied the princess , ` I can justly reproach thee with doing so . ' The lion answered fiercely , ` Thou shalt quickly have thy reward for the trouble thou hast given me to return . ' With that he opened his terrible throat , and ran at her to devour her , but she , being on her guard , leaped backward , got time to pull out one of her hairs and , by pronouncing three or four words , changed it into a sharp sword , wherewith she cut the lion through the middle in two pieces . The two parts of the lion vanished , and the head only was left , which changed itself into a large scorpion . Immediately the princess turned herself into a serpent , and fought the scorpion , who finding himself worsted , took the shape of an eagle , and flew away ; but the serpent at the same time took also the shape of an eagle that was black and much stronger , and pursued him , so that we lost sight of them both . Some time after they had disappeared , the ground opened before us , and out of it came forth a cat , black and white , with her hair standing upright , and mewing in a frightful manner ; a black wolf followed her close , and gave her no time to rest . The cat , being thus hard beset , changed herself into a worm , and being nigh to a pomegranate that had accidentally fallen from a tree that grew on the side of a canal which was deep but not broad , the worm pierced the pomegranate in an instant , and hid itself . The pomegranate swelled immediately , and became as big as a gourd , which , mounting up to the roof of the gallery , rolled there for some space backwards and forwards , fell down again into the court , and broke into several pieces . The wolf , which had in the meanwhile transformed itself into a cock , fell to picking up the seeds of the pomegranate one after another , but finding no more , he came towards us with his wings spread , making a great noise , as if he would ask us whether there were any more seeds . There was one lying on the brink of the canal , which the cock perceived as he went back , and ran speedily thither , but just as he was going to pick it up , the seed rolled into the river , and turned into a little fish . The cock jumped into the river and was turned into a pike that pursued the small fish ; they continued both under water for over two hours , and we knew not what had become of them . All of a sudden we heard terrible cries , which made us tremble , and a little while after we saw the genie and princess all in flames . They threw flashes of fire out of their mouths at each other , till they came to close quarters ; then the two fires increased , with a thick burning smoke , which mounted so high that we had reason to fear it would set the palace on fire . But we very soon had a more urgent reason for fear , for the genie , having got loose from the princess , came to the gallery where we stood , and blew flames of fire upon us . We should all have perished if the princess , running to our assistance , had not by her cries forced him to retire , and defend himself against her ; yet , notwithstanding all her exertions , she could not hinder the sultan 's beard from being burnt , and his face spoiled , nor the chief of the chamberlains from being stifled and burnt on the spot . The sultan and I expected nothing but death , when we heard a cry of ` Victory , victory ! ' and on a sudden the princess appeared in her natural shape , but the genie was reduced to a heap of ashes . The princess came near to us that she might not lose time , called for a cupful of water , which the young slave , who had received no damage , brought her . She took it , and after pronouncing some words over it , threw it upon me , saying , ` If thou art become an ape by enchantment , change thy shape , and take that of a man , which thou hadst before . ' These words were hardly uttered when I became a man as I was before . I was preparing to give thanks to the princess , but she prevented me by addressing herself to her father , thus : ` Sir , I have gained the victory over the genie , as your majesty may see ; but it is a victory that costs me dear . I have but a few minutes to live , and you will not have the satisfaction of making the match you intended ; the fire has pierced me during the terrible combat , and I find it is consuming me by degrees . This would not have happened had I perceived the last of the pomegranate seeds , and swallowed it as I did the others , when I was changed into a cock ; the genie had fled thither as to his last entrenchment , and upon that the success of the combat depended , without danger to me . This slip obliged me to have recourse to fire , and to fight with those mighty arms as I did between heaven and earth , in your presence ; for , in spite of all his redoubtable art and experience , I made the genie know that I understood more than he . I have conquered and reduced him to ashes , but I can not escape death , which is approaching . ' The sultan suffered the princess , the Lady Of Beauty , to go on with the recital of her combat , and when she had done he spoke to her in a tone that sufficiently testified his grief : ` My daughter , ' said he , ` you see in what condition your father is ; alas ! I wonder that I am yet alive ! ' He could speak no more , for his tears , sighs and sobs made him speechless ; his daughter and I wept with him . In the meantime , while we were vieing with each other in grief the princess cried , ` I burn ! I burn ! ' She found that the fire which consumed her had at last seized upon her whole body , which made her still cry ` I burn , ' until death had made an end of her intolerable pains . The effect of that fire was so extraordinary that in a few moments she was wholly reduced to ashes , like the genie . How grieved I was at so dismal a spectacle ! I had rather all my life have continued an ape or a dog than to have seen my benefactress thus miserably perish . The sultan , being afflicted beyond all that can be imagined , cried out piteously , and beat himself on his head , until being quite overcome with grief , he fainted away , which made me fear for his life . In the meantime the officers came running at the sultan 's cries , and with very much ado brought him to himself again . There was no need for him and me to give them a long narrative of this adventure , in order to convince them of their great loss . The two heaps of ashes , into which the princess and the genie had been reduced , were sufficient demonstration . The sultan was hardly able to stand , but had to be supported till he could get to his apartment . When the news of the tragical event had spread through the palace and the city , all the people bewailed the misfortune of the princess , the Lady of Beauty , and were much affected by the sultan 's affliction . Every one was in deep mourning for seven days , and many ceremonies were performed . The ashes of the genie were thrown into the air , but those of the princess were gathered into a precious urn to be kept , and the urn was set in a stately tomb which was built for that purpose on the same place where the ashes had lain . The grief which the sultan felt for the loss of his daughter threw him into a fit of illness , which confined him to his chamber for a whole month . He had not fully recovered strength when he sent for me : ` Prince , ' said he , ` hearken to the orders that I now give you ; it will cost you your life if you do not put them into execution . ' I assured him of exact obedience , upon which he went on thus : ' I have constantly lived in perfect felicity , and was never crossed by any accident : but by your arrival all the happiness I possessed is vanished ; my daughter is dead , her attendant is no more , and it is through a miracle that I am yet alive . You are the cause of all those misfortunes , for which it is impossible that I should be comforted ; therefore depart from hence in peace , without farther delay , for I myself must perish if you stay any longer : I am persuaded that your presence brings mischief along , with it . This is all I have to say to you . Depart , and beware of ever appearing again in my dominions ; no consideration whatsoever shall hinder me from making you repent of it . ' I was going to speak , but he stopped my mouth with words full of anger ; and so I was obliged to leave his palace , rejected , banished , an outcast from the world , and not knowing what would become of me . And so I became a hermit .
