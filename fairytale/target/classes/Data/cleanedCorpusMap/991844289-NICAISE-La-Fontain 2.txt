TO serve the shop as ` prentice was the lot ; Of one who had the name of Nicaise got ; A lad quite ignorant beyond his trade , And what arithmetick might lend him aid ; A perfect novice in the wily art , That in amours is used to win the heart . Good tradesmen formerly were late to learn The tricks that soon in friars we discern ; They ne'er were known those lessons to begin , Till more than down appeared upon the chin . But now-a-days , in practice , ` tis confessed , These shopkeepers are knowing as the best . OUR lad of ancient date was less advanced ; At scenes of love his eyes had never glanced ; Be that as ` twill , he now was in the way , And naught but want of wit produced delay : A belle indeed had on him set her heart His master 's daughter felt LOVE 'S poignant smart ; A girl of most engaging mind and mien , And always steady in her conduct seen . Sincerity of soul or humor free , Or whether with her taste it might agree , A fool 'twas clear presided o ` er her soul , And all her thoughts and actions felt control . Some bold gallant would p ` erhaps inform her plain , She ever kept wild Folly in her train , And nothing say to me who tales relate ; But oft on reason such proceedings wait . If you a goddess love , advance she 'll make ; Our belle the same advantages would take . Her fortune , wit , and charm , attention drew , And many sparks would anxiously pursue ; How happy he who should her heart obtain , And Hymen prove he had not sighed in vain ! But she had promised , to the modest youth , Who first was named , her confidence and truth ; The little god of pleasing soft desire With full compliance with his whims require . THe belle was pleased the ` prentice to prefer : A handsome lad with truth we may aver , Quite young , well made , with fascinating eye : Such charms are ne'er despised we may rely , But treasures thought , no FAIR will e ` er neglect ; Whate'er her senses say , she 'll these respect . For one that LOVE lays hold of by the soul , A thousand by the eyes receive control . THIS sprightly girl with soft endearing ease , Exerted ev ` ry care the lad to please , To his regards she never shy appeared ; Now pinched his arm , then smiled and often leered ; Her hand across his eyes would sometimes put ; At others try to step upon his foot . To this he nothing offered in reply , Though oft his throbbing bosom heaved a sigh . So many tender scenes , at length we find , Produced the explanation LOVE designed ; The youthful couple , we may well believe , Would from each other mutual vows receive ; They neither promises nor kisses spared , Incalculable were the numbers shared ; If he had tried to keep exact account , He soon had been bewildered with th ' amount ; To such infinity it clearly ran , Mistakes would rise if he pursued the plan ; A ceremony solely was required , Which prudent girls have always much admired , Yet this to wait gave pain and made her grieve ; From you , said she , the boon I would receive ; Or while I live the rapture never know , That Hymen at his altar can bestow ; To you I promise , by the pow ` rs divine , My hand and heart I truly will resign . Howe'er I 'll freely say , should Hymen fail To make me your 's and wishes not prevail , You must not fancy I 'll become a nun , Though much I hope to act as I 've begun ; To marry you would please me to the soul ; But how can WE the ruling pow ` rs control ? Too much I 'm confident you love my fame , To aim at what might bring me soon to shame : In wedlock I 've been asked by that and this ; My father thinks these offers not amiss ; But , Nicaise , I 'll allow you still to hope , That if with others I 'm obliged to cope , No matter whether counsellor or judge . Since clearly ev ` ry thing to such I grudge , The marriage eve , or morn , or day , or hour , To you I 'll give -- the first enchanting flow ` r. THE lad most gratefully his thanks returned ; His breast with ev ` ry soft emotion burned . Within a week , to this sweet charmer came , A rich young squire , who soon declared his flame ; On which she said to Nicaise : -- he will do ; This spark will easily let matters through ; And as the belle was confident of that , She gave consent and listened to his chat . Soon all was settled and arranged the day , When marriage they no longer would delay , You 'll fully notice this : -- I think I view The thoughts which move around and you pursue ; 'Twas doubtless clear , whatever bliss in store , The lady was betrothed , and nothing more . THOUGH all was fixed a week before the day , Yet fearing accidents might things delay , Or even break the treaty ere complete , She would not our apprentice fully greet , Till on the very morn she gave her hand , Lest chance defeated what was nicely planned . HOWE ` ER the belle was to the altar led , A virgin still , and doomed the squire to wed , Who , quite impatient , consummation sought , As soon as he the charmer back had brought ; But she solicited the day apart , And this obtained , alone by prayers and art . 'Twas early morn , and ` stead of bed she dressed , In ev ` ry thing a queen had thought the best ; With diamonds , pearls , and various jewels rare ; Her husband riches had , she was aware , Which raised her into rank that dress required , And all her neighbors envied and admired . Her lover , to secure the promised bliss , An hour 's indulgence gained to take a kiss . A bow ` r within a garden was the spot , Which , for their private meeting , they had got . A confidant had been employed around , To watch if any one were lurking found . THE lady was the first who thither came ; To get a nosegay was , she said , her aim ; And Nicaise presently her steps pursued , Who , when the turf within the bow ` r he viewed , Exclaimed , oh la ! how wet it is my dear ! Your handsome clothes will be spoiled I fear ! A carpet let me instantly provide ? Deuce take the clothes ! the fair with anger cried ; Ne'er think of that : I 'll say I had a fall ; Such accident a loss I would not call , When Time so clearly on the wing appears , ` Tis right to banish scruples , cares , and fears ; Nor think of clothes nor dress , however fine , But those to dirt or flames at once resign ; Far better this than precious time to waste , Since frequently in minutes bliss we taste ; A quarter of an hour we now should prize , The place no doubt will very well suffice ; With you it rests such moments to employ , And mutually our bosoms fill with joy . I scarcely ought to say what now I speak , But anxiously your happiness I seek . INDEED , the anxious , tender youth replied , To save such costly clothes we should decide ; I 'll run at once , and presently be here ; Two minutes will suffice I 'm very clear . AWAY the silly lad with ardor flew , And left no time objections to renew . His wondrous folly cured the charming dame ; Whose soul so much disdained her recent flame ; That instantly her heart resumed its place , Which had too long been loaded with disgrace : Go , prince of fools , she to herself exclaimed , For ever , of thy conduct , be ashamed ; To lose thee surely I can ne'er regret , Impossible a worse I could have met . I 've now considered , and ` tis very plain , Thou merit ` st not such favors to obtain ; From hence I swear , by ev ` ry thing above ; My husband shall alone possess my love ; And least I might be tempted to betray , To him I 'll instantly the boon convey , Which Nicaise might have easily received ; Thank Heav ` n my breast from folly is relieved . This said , by disappointment rendered sour , The beauteous bride in anger left the bow ` r. Soon with the carpet simple Nicaise came , And found that things no longer were the same . THE lucky hour , ye suitors learn I pray , Is not each time the clock strikes through the day , In Cupid 's alphabet I think I 've read , Old Time , by lovers , likes not to be led ; And since so closely he pursues his plan , ` Tis right to seize him , often as you can . Delays are dangerous , in love or war , And Nicaise is a proof they fortune mar. . QUITE out of breath with having quickly run ; Delighted too that he so soon had done , The youth returned most anxious to employ , The carpet for his mistress to enjoy , But she alas ! with rage upon her brow , Had left the spot , he knew not why nor how ; And to her company returned in haste The flame extinguished that her mind disgraced . Perhaps she went the jewel to bestow , Upon her spouse , whose breast with joy would glow : What jewel pray ? -- The one that ev ` ry maid Pretends to have , whatever tricks she 's played . This I believe ; but I 'll no dangers run ; To burn my fingers I 've not yet begun ; Yet I allow , howe'er , in such a case , The girl , who fibs , therein no sin can trace . OUR belle who , thanks to Nicaise , yet retained ; In spite of self , the flow ` r he might have gained , Was grumbling still , when he the lady met Why , how is this , cried he , did you forget , That for this carpet I had gone away ? When spread , how nicely on it we might play ! You 'd soon to woman change the silly maid ; Come , let 's return , and not the bliss evade ; No fear of dirt nor spoiling of your dress ; And then my love I fully will express . NOT so , replied the disappointed dame , We 'll put it off : -- perhaps ` twould hurt your frame Your health I value , and I would advise , To be at ease , take breath , and prudence prize ; Apprentice in a shop you now are bound Next ` prentice go to some gallant around ; You 'll not so soon his pleasing art require , Nor to your tutorage can I now aspire . Friend Nicaise take some neighb ` ring servant maid , You 're quite a master in the shopping trade ; Stuffs you can sell , and ask the highest price ; And to advantage turn things in a trice . But opportunity you ca n't discern ; To know its value , -- prithee go and learn .
