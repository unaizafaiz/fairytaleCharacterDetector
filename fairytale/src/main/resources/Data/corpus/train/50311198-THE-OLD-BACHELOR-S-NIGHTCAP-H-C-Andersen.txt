There is a street in Copenhagen that has this strange name -- `` Hysken Straede . '' Whence comes this name , and what is its meaning ? It is said to be German ; but injustice has been done to the Germans in this matter , for it would have to be `` Haeuschen , '' and not `` Hysken . '' For here stood , once upon a time , and indeed for a great many years , a few little houses , which were principally nothing more than wooden booths , just as we see now in the market-places at fair-time . They were , perhaps , a little larger , and had windows ; but the panes consisted of horn or bladder , for glass was then too expensive to be used in every house . But then we are speaking of a long time ago -- so long since , that grandfather and great-grandfather , when they talked about them , used to speak of them as `` the old times '' -- in fact , it is several centuries ago . The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck carried on trade with Copenhagen . They did not reside in the town themselves , but sent their clerks , who lived in the wooden booths in the Haeuschen Street , and sold beer and spices . The German beer was good , and there were many kinds of it , as there were , for instance , Bremen , and Prussinger , and Sous beer , and even Brunswick mumm ; and quantities of spices were sold -- saffron , and aniseed , and ginger , and especially pepper . Yes , pepper was the chief article here , and so it happened that the German clerks got the nickname `` pepper gentry ; '' and there was a condition made with them in Lubeck and in Bremen , that they would not marry at Copenhagen , and many of them became very old . They had to care for themselves , and to look after their own comforts , and to put out their own fires -- when they had any ; and some of them became very solitary old boys , with eccentric ideas and eccentric habits . From them all unmarried men , who have attained a certain age , are called in Denmark `` pepper gentry ; '' and this must be understood by all who wish to comprehend this history . The `` pepper gentleman '' becomes a butt for ridicule , and is continually told that he ought to put on his nightcap , and draw it down over his eyes , and do nothing but sleep . The boys sing , `` Cut , cut wood ! Poor bachelor so good . Go , take your nightcap , go to rest , For ` tis the nightcap suits you best ! '' Yes , that 's what they sing about the `` pepperer '' -- thus they make game of the poor bachelor and his nightcap , and turn it into ridicule , just because they know very little about either . Ah , that kind of nightcap no one should wish to earn ! And why not ? -- We shall hear . -LRB- Illustration : THE PEPPERER 'S BOOTH . aaaaa -RRB- aaa In the old times the `` Housekin Street '' was not paved , and the people stumbled out of one hole into another , as in a neglected bye-way ; and it was narrow too . The booths leaned side by side , and stood so close together that in the summer time a sail was often stretched from one booth to its opposite neighbor , on which occasion the fragrance of pepper , saffron , and ginger became doubly powerful . Behind the counters young men were seldom seen . The clerks were generally old boys ; but they did not look like what we should fancy them , namely , with wig , and nightcap , and plush small-clothes , and with waistcoat and coat buttoned up to the chin . No , grandfather 's great-grandfather may look like that , and has been thus portrayed , but the `` pepper gentry '' had no superfluous means , and accordingly did not have their portraits taken ; though , indeed , it would be interesting now to have a picture of one of them , as he stood behind the counter or went to church on holy days . His hat was high-crowned and broad-brimmed , and sometimes one of the youngest clerks would mount a feather . The woollen shirt was hidden behind a broad linen collar , the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin , and the cloak hung loose over it ; and the trousers were tucked into the broad-toed shoes , for the clerks did not wear stockings . In their girdles they sported a dinner-knife and spoon , and a larger knife was placed there also for the defense of the owner ; and this weapon was often very necessary . Just so was Anthony , one of the oldest clerks , clad on high days and holy days , except that , instead of a high-crowned hat , he wore a low bonnet , and under it a knitted cap -LRB- a regular nightcap -RRB- , to which he had grown so accustomed that it was always on his head ; and he had two of them -- nightcaps , of course . The old fellow was a subject for a painter . He was as thin as a lath , had wrinkles clustering round his eyes and mouth , and long bony fingers , and bushy gray eyebrows : over the left eye hung quite a tuft of hair , and that did not look very handsome , though it made him very noticeable . People knew that he came from Bremen ; but that was not his native place , though his master lived there . His own native place was in Thuringia , the town of Eisenach , close by the Wartburg . Old Anthony did not speak much of this , but he thought of it all the more . The old clerks of the Haeuschen Street did not often come together . Each one remained in his booth , which was closed early in the evening ; and then it looked dark enough in the street : only a faint glimmer of light forced its way through the little horn-pane in the roof ; and in the booth sat , generally on his bed , the old bachelor , his German hymn-book in his hand , singing an evening psalm in a low voice ; or he went about in the booth till late into the night , and busied himself about all sorts of things . It was certainly not an amusing life . To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot : nobody cares for you , unless you happen to get in anybody 's way . Often when it was dark night outside , with snow and rain , the place looked very gloomy and lonely . No lamps were to be seen , with the exception of one solitary light hanging before the picture of the Virgin that was fastened against the wall . The plash of the water against the neighbouring rampart at the castle wharf could be plainly heard . Such evenings are long and dreary , unless people devise some employment for themselves . There is not always packing or unpacking to do , nor can the scales be polished or paper bags be made continually ; and , failing these , people should devise other employment for themselves . And that is just what old Anthony did ; for he used to mend his clothes and put pieces on his boots . When he at last sought his couch , he used from habit to keep his nightcap on . He drew it down a little closer ; but soon he would push it up again , to see if the light had been properly extinguished . He would touch it , press the wick together , and then lie down on the other side , and draw his nightcap down again ; but then a doubt would come upon him , if every coal in the little fire-pan below had been properly deadened and put out -- a tiny spark might have been left burning , and might set fire to something and cause damage . And therefore he rose from his bed , and crept down the ladder , for it could scarcely be called a stair . And when he came to the fire-pan not a spark was to be discovered , and he might just go back again . But often , when he had gone half of the way back , it would occur to him that the shutters might not be securely fastened ; yes , then his thin legs must carry him downstairs once more . He was cold , and his teeth chattered in his mouth when he crept back again to bed ; for the cold seems to become doubly severe when it knows it can not stay much longer . He drew up the coverlet closer around him , and pulled down the nightcap lower over his brows , and turned his thoughts away from trade and from the labors of the day . But that did not procure him agreeable entertainment ; for now old thoughts came and put up their curtains , and these curtains have sometimes pins in them , with which one pricks oneself , and one cries out `` Oh ! '' and they prick into one 's flesh and burn so , that the tears sometimes come into one 's eyes ; and that often happened to old Anthony -- hot tears . The largest pearls streamed forth , and fell on the coverlet or on the floor , and then they sounded as if one of his heart-strings had broken . Sometimes again they seemed to rise up in flame , illuminating a picture of life that never faded out of his heart . If he then dried his eyes with his nightcap , the tear and the picture were indeed crushed , but the source of the tears remained , and welled up afresh from his heart . The pictures did not come up in the order in which the scenes had occurred in reality , for very often the most painful would come together ; then again the most joyful would come , but these had the deepest shadows of all . The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged to be fine , but the woods of Thuringia arose far more beautiful in the eyes of Anthony . More mighty and more venerable seemed to him the old oaks around the proud knightly castle , where the creeping plants hung down over the stony blocks of the rock ; sweeter there bloomed the flowers of the apple tree than in the Danish land . This he remembered very vividly . A glittering tear rolled down over his cheek ; and in this tear he could plainly see two children playing -- a boy and a girl . The boy had red cheeks , and yellow curling hair , and honest blue eyes . He was the son of the merchant Anthony -- it was himself . The little girl had brown eyes and black hair , and had a bright clever look . She was the burgomaster 's daughter Molly . The two were playing with an apple . They shook the apple , and heard the pips rattling in it . Then they cut the apple in two , and each of them took a half ; they divided even the pips , and ate them all but one , which the little girl proposed that they should lay in the earth . `` Then you shall see , '' she said , `` what will come out . It will be something you do n't at all expect . A whole apple tree will come out , but not directly . '' And she put the pip in a flower-pot , and both were very busy and eager about it . The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger , and the little girl dropped the pip in it , and they both covered it with earth . `` Now , you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has struck root , '' said Molly . `` That wo n't do at all . I did it with my flowers ; but only twice . I wanted to see if they were growing -- and I did n't know any better then -- and the plants withered . '' Anthony took away the flower-pot , and every morning , the whole winter through , he looked at it ; but nothing was to be seen but the black earth . At length , however , the spring came , and the sun shone warm again ; and two little green leaves came up out of the pot . `` Those are for me and Molly , '' said the boy . `` That 's beautiful -- that 's marvellously beautiful ! '' Soon a third leaf made its appearance . Whom did that represent ? Yes , and there came another , and yet another . Day by day and week by week they grew larger , and the plant began to take the form of a real tree . And all this was now mirrored in a single tear , which was wiped away and disappeared ; but it might come again from its source in the heart of old Anthony . In the neighborhood of Eisenach a row of stony mountains rises up . One of these mountains is round in outline , and lifts itself above the rest , naked and without tree , bush , or grass . It is called the Venus Mount . In this mountain dwells Lady Venus , one of the deities of the heathen times . She is also called Lady Holle ; and every child in and around Eisenach has heard about her . She it was who lured Tannhauser , the noble knight and minstrel , from the circle of the singers of the Wartburg into her mountain . -LRB- Illustration : IMPERTINENT MOLLY . aaaaa -RRB- aaa Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain ; and once Molly said : `` You may knock and say , ` Lady Holle , open the door -- Tannhauser is here ! '' But Anthony did not dare . Molly , however , did it , though she only said the words `` Lady Holle , Lady Holle ! '' aloud and distinctly ; the rest she muttered so indistinctly that Anthony felt convinced she had not really said anything ; and yet she looked as bold and saucy as possible -- as saucy as when she sometimes came round him with other little girls in the garden , and all wanted to kiss him because he did not like to be kissed and tried to keep them off ; and she was the only one who dared to kiss him in spite of his resistance . '' _ I _ may kiss him ! '' she would say proudly . That was her vanity ; and Anthony submitted , and thought no more about it . How charming and how teasing Molly was ! It was said that Lady Holle in the mountain was beautiful also , but that her beauty was like that of a tempting fiend . The greatest beauty and grace was possessed by Saint Elizabeth , the patron of the country , the pious Princess of Thuringia , whose good actions have been immortalized in many places in legends and stories . In the chapel her picture was hanging , surrounded by silver lamps ; but it was not in the least like Molly . The apple tree which the two children had planted grew year by year , and became taller and taller -- so tall , that it had to be transplanted into the garden , into the fresh air , where the dew fell and the sun shone warm . And the tree developed itself strongly , so that it could resist the winter . And it seemed as if , after the rigor of the cold season was past , it put forth blossoms in spring for very joy . In the autumn it brought two apples -- one for Molly and one for Anthony . It could not well have produced less . The tree had grown apace , and Molly grew like the tree . She was as fresh as an apple-blossom ; but Anthony was not long to behold this flower . All things change ! Molly 's father left his old home , and Molly went with him , far away . Yes , in our time steam has made the journey they took a matter of a few hours , but then more than a day and a night were necessary to go so far eastward from Eisenach to the furthest border of Thuringia , to the city which is still called Weimar . And Molly wept , and Anthony wept ; but all their tears melted into one , and this tear had the rosy , charming hue of joy . For Molly told him she loved him -- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar . One , two , three years went by , and during this period two letters were received . One came by a carrier , and a traveller brought the other . The way was long and difficult , and passed through many windings by towns and villages . Often had Molly and Anthony heard of Tristram and Iseult , and often had the boy applied the story to himself and Molly , though the name Tristram was said to mean `` born in tribulation , '' and that did not apply to Anthony , nor would he ever be able to think , like Tristram , `` She has forgotten me . '' But , indeed , Iseult did not forget her faithful knight ; and when both were laid to rest in the earth , one on each side of the church , the linden trees grew from their graves over the church roof , and there encountered each other in bloom . Anthony thought that was beautiful , but mournful ; but it could not become mournful between him and Molly : and he whistled a song of the old minne-singer , Walter of the Vogelverde : `` Under the lindens Upon the heath . '' And especially that passage appeared charming to him : `` From the forest , down in the vale , Sang her sweet song the nightingale . '' This song was often in his mouth , and he sang and whistled it in the moonlight nights , when he rode along the deep hollow way on horseback to get to Weimar and visit Molly . He wished to come unexpectedly , and he came unexpectedly . He was made welcome with full goblets of wine , with jovial company , fine company , and a pretty room and a good bed were provided for him ; and yet his reception was not what he had dreamt and fancied it would be . He could not understand himself -- he could not understand the others : but _ we _ can understand it . One may be admitted into a house and associate with a family without becoming one of them . One may converse together as one would converse in a post-carriage , and know one another as people know each other on a journey , each incommoding the other and wishing that either oneself or the good neighbor were away . Yes , this was the kind of thing Anthony felt . `` I am an honest girl , '' said Molly ; `` and I myself will tell you what it is . Much has changed since we were children together -- changed inwardly and outwardly . Habit and will have no power over our hearts . Anthony , I should not like to have an enemy in you , now that I shall soon be far away from here . Believe me , I entertain the best wishes for you ; but to feel for you what I know now one may feel for a man , has never been the case with me . You must reconcile yourself to this . Farewell , Anthony ! '' And Anthony bade her farewell . No tear came into his eye , but he felt that he was no longer Molly 's friend . Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips , and we have the same feeling when we kiss it : and he kissed himself into hatred as into love . Within twenty-four hours Anthony was back in Eisenach , though certainly the horse on which he rode was ruined . `` What matter ! '' he said : `` I am ruined too ; and I will destroy everything that can remind me of her , or of Lady Holle , or Venus the heathen woman ! I will break down the apple tree and tear it up by the roots , so that it shall never bear flower or fruit more ! '' But the apple tree was not broken down , though he himself was broken down , and bound on a couch by fever . What was it that raised him up again ? A medicine was presented to him which had strength to do this -- the bitterest of medicines , that shakes up body and spirit together . Anthony 's father ceased to be the richest of merchants . Heavy days -- days of trial -- were at the door ; misfortune came rolling into the house like great waves of the sea . The father became a poor man . Sorrow and suffering took away his strength . Then Anthony had to think of something else besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly . He had to take his father 's place -- to give orders , to help , to act energetically , and at last to go out into the world and earn his bread . Anthony went to Bremen . There he learned what poverty and hard living meant ; and these sometimes make the heart hard , and sometimes soften it , even too much . How different the world was , and how different the people were from what he had supposed them to be in his childhood ! What were the minne-singer 's songs to him now ? -- an echo , a vanishing sound ! Yes , that is what he thought sometimes ; but again the songs would sound in his soul , and his heart became gentle . `` God 's will is best ! '' he would say then . `` It was well that I was not permitted to keep Molly 's heart -- that she did not remain true to me . What would it have led to now , when fortune has turned away from me ? She quitted me before she knew of this loss of prosperity , or had any notion of what awaited me . That was a mercy of Providence towards me . Everything has happened for the best . It was not her fault -- and I have been so bitter , and have shown so much rancor towards her ! '' And years went by . Anthony 's father was dead , and strangers lived in the old house . But Anthony was destined to see it again . His rich employer sent him on commercial journeys , and his duty led him into his native town of Eisenach . The old Wartburg stood unchanged on the mountain , with `` the monk and the nun '' hewn out in stone . The great oaks gave to the scene the outlines it had possessed in his childish days . The Venus Mount glimmered gray and naked over the valley . He would have been glad to cry , `` Lady Holle , Lady Holle , unlock the door , and I shall enter and remain in my native earth ! '' That was a sinful thought , and he blessed himself to drive it away . Then a little bird out of the thicket sang clearly , and the old minne-song came into his mind : `` From the forest , down in the vale , Sang her sweet song the nightingale . '' And here in the town of his childhood , which he thus saw again through tears , much came back into his remembrance . The paternal house stood as in the old times ; but the garden was altered , and a field-path led over a portion of the old ground , and the apple tree that he had not broken down stood there , but outside the garden , on the farther side of the path . But the sun threw its rays on the apple tree as in the old days , the dew descended gently upon it as then , and it bore such a burden of fruit that the branches were bent down towards the earth . `` That flourishes ! '' he said . `` The tree can grow ! '' Nevertheless , one of the branches of the tree was broken . Mischievous hands had torn it down towards the ground ; for now the tree stood by the public way . `` They break its blossoms off without a feeling of thankfulness -- they steal its fruit and break the branches . One might say of the tree as has been said of some men -- ` It was not sung at his cradle that it should come thus . ' How brightly its history began , and what has it come to ? Forsaken and forgotten -- a garden tree by the hedge , in the field , and on the public way ! There it stands unprotected , plundered , and broken ! It has certainly not died , but in the course of years the number of blossoms will diminish ; at last the fruit will cease altogether ; and at last -- at last all will be over ! '' Such were Anthony 's thoughts under the tree ; such were his thoughts during many a night in the lonely chamber of the wooden house in the distant land -- in the Haeuschen Street in Copenhagen , whither his rich employer , the Bremen merchant , had sent him , first making it a condition that he should not marry . `` Marry ! Ha , ha ! '' he laughed bitterly to himself . Winter had set in early ; it was freezing hard . Without , a snow-storm was raging , so that every one who could do so remained at home ; thus , too , it happened that those who lived opposite to Anthony did not notice that for two days his house had not been unlocked , and that he did not show himself ; for who would go out unnecessarily in such weather ? They were gray , gloomy days ; and in the house , whose windows were not of glass , twilight only alternated with dark night . Old Anthony had not left his bed during the two days , for he had not the strength to rise ; he had for a long time felt in his limbs the hardness of the weather . Forsaken by all , lay the old bachelor , unable to help himself . He could scarcely reach the water-jug that he had placed by his bedside , and the last drop it contained had been consumed . It was not fever , nor sickness , but old age that had struck him down . Up yonder , where his couch was placed , he was overshadowed as it were by continual night . A little spider , which , however , he could not see , busily and cheerfully span its web around him , as if it were weaving a little crape banner that should wave when the old man closed his eyes . The time was very slow , and long , and dreary . Tears he had none to shed , nor did he feel pain . The thought of Molly never came into his mind . He felt as if the world and its noise concerned him no longer -- as if he were lying outside the world , and no one were thinking of him . For a moment he felt a sensation of hunger -- of thirst . Yes , he felt them both . But nobody came to tend him -- nobody . He thought of those who had once suffered want ; of Saint Elizabeth , as she had once wandered on earth ; of her , the saint of his home and of his childhood , the noble Duchess of Thuringia , the benevolent lady who had been accustomed to visit the lowliest cottages , bringing to the inmates refreshment and comfort . Her pious deeds shone bright upon his soul . He thought of her as she had come to distribute words of comfort , binding up the wounds of the afflicted , giving meat to the hungry ; though her stern husband had chidden her for it . He thought of the legend told of her , how she had been carrying the full basket containing food and wine , when her husband , who watched her footsteps , came forth and asked angrily what she was carrying , whereupon she answered , in fear and trembling , that the basket contained roses which she had plucked in the garden ; how he had torn away the white cloth from the basket , and a miracle had been performed for the pious lady ; for bread , and wine , and everything in the basket had been transformed into roses ! Thus the saint 's memory dwelt in Anthony 's quiet mind ; thus she stood bodily before his downcast face , before his warehouse in the simple booth in the Danish land . He uncovered his head , and looked into her gentle eyes , and everything around him was beautiful and roseate . Yes , the roses seemed to unfold themselves in fragrance . There came to him a sweet , peculiar odour of apples , and he saw a blooming apple tree , which spread its branches above him -- it was the tree which Molly and he had planted together . And the tree strewed down its fragrant leaves upon him , cooling his burning brow . The leaves fell upon his parched lips , and were like strengthening bread and wine ; and they fell upon his breast , and he felt reassured and calm , and inclined to sleep peacefully . `` Now I shall sleep , '' he whispered to himself . `` Sleep is refreshing . To-morrow I shall be upon my feet again , and strong and well -- glorious , wonderful ! That apple tree , planted in true affection , now stands before me in heavenly radiance -- '' -LRB- Illustration : THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR LOOKS AFTER OLD ANTHONY . aaaaa -RRB- aaa And he slept . The day afterwards -- it was the third day that his shop had remained closed -- the snow-storm had ceased , and a neighbor from the opposite house came over towards the booth where dwelt old Anthony , who had not yet shown himself . Anthony lay stretched upon his bed -- dead -- with his old cap clutched tightly in his two hands ! They did not put that cap on his head in his coffin , for he had a new white one . Where were now the tears that he had wept ? What had become of the pearls ? They remained in the nightcap -- and the true ones do not come out in the wash -- they were preserved in the nightcap , and in time forgotten ; but the old thoughts and the old dreams still remained in the `` bachelor 's nightcap . '' Do n't wish for such a cap for yourself . It would make your forehead very hot , would make your pulse beat feverishly , and conjure up dreams which appear like reality . The first who wore that identical cap afterwards felt all that at once , though it was half a century afterwards ; and that man was the burgomaster himself , who , with his wife and eleven children , was well and firmly established , and had amassed a very tolerable amount of wealth . He was immediately seized with dreams of unfortunate love , of bankruptcy , and of heavy times . `` Hallo ! how the nightcap burns ! '' he cried out , and tore it from his head . And a pearl rolled out , and another , and another , and they sounded and glittered . `` This must be gout , '' said the burgomaster . `` Something dazzles my eyes ! '' They were tears , shed half a century before by old Anthony from Eisenach . Every one who afterwards put that nightcap upon his head had visions and dreams which excited him not a little . His own history was changed into that of Anthony , and became a story ; in fact , many stories . But some one else may tell _ them _ . We have told the first . And our last word is -- do n't wish for `` The Old Bachelor 's Nightcap . ''
