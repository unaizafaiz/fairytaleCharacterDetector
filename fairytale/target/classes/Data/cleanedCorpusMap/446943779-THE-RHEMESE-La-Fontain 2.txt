NO city I to Rheims would e ` er prefer : Of France the pride and honor I aver ; The Holy Ampoule \* and delicious wine , Which ev ` ry one regards as most divine , We 'll set apart , and other objects take : The beauties round a paradise might make ! I mean not tow ` rs nor churches , gates , nor streets ; But charming belles with soft enchanting sweets : Such oft among the fair Rhemese we view : Kings might be proud those graces to pursue . ONE ` mong these belles had to the altar led , A painter , much esteemed , and who had bread . What more was requisite ! -- he lived at ease , And by his occupation sought to please . A happy woman all believed his wife ; The husband 's talents pleased her to the life : For gallantry howe'er he was renowned , And many am ` rous dames , who dwelled around , Would seek the artist with a double aim : So all our chronicles record his fame . But since much penetration 's not my boast , I just believe -- what 's requisite at most . WHENE ` ER the painter had in hand a fair , He 'd jest his wife , and laugh with easy air ; But Hymen 's rights proceeding as they ought , With jealous fears her breast was never fraught . She might indeed repay his tricks in kind , And gratify , in soft amours , her mind , Except that she less confidence had shown , And was not led to him the truth to own . AMONG the men attracted by her smiles , Two neighbors , much delighted with her wiles ; Were often tempted , by her sprightly wit , To listen to her chat , and with her sit ; For she had far the most engaging mien , Of any charmer that around was seen . Superior understanding she possessed ; Though fond of laughter , frolick , fun , and jest . She to her husband presently disclosed The love these cit-gallants to her proposed ; Both known for arrant blockheads through the town , And ever boasting of their own renown . To him she gave their various speeches , tones , Each silly air : their tears , and sighs , and groans ; They 'd read , or rather heard , we may believe , That , when in love , with sighs fond bosoms heave . Their utmost to succeed these coxcombs tried , And seemed convinced they should not be denied ; A common cause they would the business hold , And what one knew the other must be told . Whichever first a favor might obtain , Should tell his happiness to t ` other swain . YE FAIR ` tis thus they oft your kindness treat : The pleasure that he wished alone is sweet . LOVE , is no more ; of t ` other , laid in earth , We 've here no traces scarcely from the birth . You serve for sport and prey , to giddy youth , Devoid of talents , principles , and truth . ` Tis right they should suppose , still two are found ; Who take their course continually round . The first that in your pleasure grounds appears ; I 'd have you , on his wings , to use the shears . OUR lady then , her lovers to deceive , One day observed -- you shall , my friends , this eve ; Drink wine with me : -- my husband will away , And , what 's delightful , till to-morrow stay ; We shall ourselves be able to amuse , And laugh , and sing , and talk as we may choose . ` Tis excellent , cried they : things well you frame ; And at the promised hour , the heroes came . WHEN introduced , and all supposing clear , A sudden knocking turned their joy to fear ; The door was barred ; she to the window flew ; I think , said she , that 's to the master due ; And should it prove to be as I suspect : -- ` Tis he , I vow : -- fly , hide , he 'll you detect ; Some accident , suspicion , or design , Has brought him back to sleep , I now divine : OUR two gallants , when dangers round them pressed , A closet entered , mightily distressed ; To get away ` twere folly to have tried ; The husband came , the roast he quickly spied ; With pigeons too , in diff ` rent fashions cooked ; Why , hey ! said he , as round about he looked : What guests have you that supper you prepare ? The wife replied : two neighbors taste our fare : Sweet Alice , and good Simonetta , mean To-night , at table with us to be seen ; I 'm quite rejoiced to think that you are here : The company will more complete appear ; These dames will , by your presence , nothing lose ; I 'll run and hasten them : ` twill you amuse ; The whole is ready ; I 'll at once away , And beg , in coming , they 'll no more delay . THE ladies named were wives of our gallants , So fond of contraband , and smuggled grants , Who , vexed to be confined , still praised the dame , For skewing such address to ` scape from blame . She soon returned , and with her brought the FAIR , Who , gaily singing , entered free from care . The painter them received with bow and kiss ; To praise their beauty he was not remiss ; Their dress was charming ; all he much admired ; Their presence frolick , fun , and jest inspired , Which no way pleased the husbands in the cage , Who saw the freaks with marks of bursting rage : The door half open gave a view complete , How freely he their wives was led to treat . THINGS thus commenced , the supper next was served ; From playful tricks the painter never swerved , But placed himself at table ` twist the two , And jest and frolicking would still pursue . To women , wine , and fun , said he , I drink ; Put round the toast ; none from it e ` er must shrink ; The order was obeyed ; the glass oft filled The party soon had all the liquor swilled : THE wife just then , it seems , no servant kept ; More wine to get , she to the cellar stept . But dreading ghosts , she Simonetta prayed ; To light her down , she was so much afraid . THE painter was alone with Alice left , A country belle , of beauty not bereft : Slight , nicely made , with rather pretty face , She thought herself possessed of ev ` ry grace , And , in a country town , she well might get The appellation of a gay coquette . THE wily spark , perceiving no one near ; Soon ran from compliment to sweet and dear ; Her lips assailed ; -- the tucker drew aside , And stole a kiss that hurt her husband 's pride , Who all beheld ; but spouses , that are sage , No trifles heed , nor peccadillos page ; Though , doubtless , when such meetings are possessed , The simple kiss gives room to dread the rest ; For when the devil whispers in the ear Of one that sleeps , he wakes at once to fear . THE husband , howsoe'er , at length perceived Still more concessions , which his bosom grieved ; While on the neck a hand appeared to please , The other wandered equally at ease ; Be not offended , love ! was often said ; To frantick rage the sight her sposo led , Who , beating in his hat , was on the move To sally forth , his wrath to let them prove , To thrash his wife , and force her spark to feel his nervous arm could quickly make him reel . BE not so silly , whispered t ` other Wight ; To stir up noise could ne'er be reckoned right ; Be quiet now : consider where we are ; Keep close , or else you 'll all our pleasures mar ; Remember , written ` tis , By others do The same as you would like they should by you ; ` Tis proper in this place we should remain Till all is hushed in sleep : then freedom gain ; That 's my opinion how we ought to act Are you not half a cuckold now , in fact ? Fair Alice has consented : - that 's enough ; The rest is mere compliance , nonsense , stuff ! THE husband seemed the reasons to approve ; Some slight attempts the lady made to move ; No time for more . What then ? you ask : -- Why , then -- The lady put her cap to rights agen ; No mark appeared suspicion to awake , Except her cheek a scarlet hue might take . Mere trifle that ; from talking it might spring ; And other causes , doubtless , we could bring . ONE of the belles , howe'er , who went for wine , Smiled , on returning , at the blushing sign : The painter 's wife ; but soon they filled each glass , And briskly round the bottle seemed to pass ; They drank the host , the hostess , and the FAIR , Who , ` mong the three , should first her wishes share . AT length , a second time the bottle failed ; The hostess ' fear of ghosts again prevailed , And mistress Alice now for escort went , Though much she wished the other to have sent ; With Simonetta she was forced to change , And leave the painter at his ease to range . THIS dame at first appeared to be severe Would leave the room , and feigned to be sincere ; But when the painter seized her by the gown , She prudence showed , and feared he 'd pull her down ; Her clothes might tear , which led her to remain : On this the husband scarcely could contain ; He seemed resolved his hiding place to leave ; But instantly the other pulled his sleeve ; Be easy friend , said he , it is but right , That equal favors we should have to-night , And cuckoldom should take you to his care , That we alike in ev ` ry thing may fare . ARE we not brothers in adventure , pray ? And such our solemn promises , to-day . Since one the painter clearly has disgraced , The other equally should be embraced . In spite of ev ` ry thing you now advance , Your wife as well as mine shall have a dance ; A hand I 'll lend , if wanting it be found ; Say what you will , I 'll see she has her round . She had it then : -- our painter tried to please ; The lady equally appeared at ease ; Full time the others gave , and when they came , More wine was not required by spark nor dame ; 'Twas late , and for the day enough he 'd done ; Good night was said : their course the belles had run ; The painter , satisfied , retired to rest ; The gay gallants , who lay so long distressed , The wily hostess from the closet drew , Abashed , disconsolate , and cuckolds too ; Still worse to think , with all their care and pain ; That neither of them could his wish obtain , Or e ` en return the dame what she procured Their wives , whom she so cleverly allured . HERE ends our tale ; the business is complete ; In soft amours success alone is sweet . \* The Saint Ampoule , or Holy Ampulla , a vial said to have descended from heaven , in which was oil for anointing the kings of France at the coronation , and formerly kept at Rheims .
