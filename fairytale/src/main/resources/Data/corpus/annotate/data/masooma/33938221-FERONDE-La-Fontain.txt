IN Eastern climes , by means considered new ; The Mount 's old-man , with terrors would pursue ; His large domains howe'er were not the cause , Nor heaps of gold , that gave him such applause , But manners strange his subjects to persuade ; In ev ` ry wish , to serve him they were made . Among his people boldest hearts he chose , And to their view would Paradise disclose Its blissful pleasures : -- ev ` ry soft delight , Designed to gratify the sense and sight . So plausible this prophet 's tale appeared , Each word he dropt was thoroughly revered . Whence this delusion ? -- DRINK deranged the mind ; And , reason drowned , to madness they resigned . Thus void of knowing clearly what they did , They soon were brought to act as they were bid ; Conveyed to places , charming to the eye , Enchanting gardens ` neath an azure sky , With twining shrubs , meandring walks , and flow ` rs , And num ` rous grottos , porticoes and bow ` rs . When they chanced to pass where all was gay , From wine 's inebriating pow ` rful sway , They wondered at the frolicking around , And fancied they were got on fairy ground , Which Mahomet pretended was assigned , For those to his doctrine were inclined . To tempt the men and girls to seek the scene , And skip and play and dance upon the green , To murm ` ring streams , meandering along , And lutes ' soft notes and nightingales ' sweet song : No earthly pleasure but might there be viewed , The best of wines and choicest fruits accrued , To render sense bewildered at the sight , And sink inebriated with delight . THEN back they bore them motionless to sleep , And wake with wishes further joys to reap . From these enjoyments many fully thought , To such enchanting scenes they should be brought , In future times , eternal bliss to taste , If death and danger valiantly they faced , And tried the prophet Mahomet to please , And ev ` ry point to serve their prince would seize . THE Mount 's old man , by means like these , could say ; He 'd men devoted to support his sway ; Upon the globe no empire more was feared , Or king or potentate like him revered . These circumstances I 've minutely told , To show , our tale was known in days of old . FERONDE , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown , A ninny was believed throughout the town ; He had the charge of revenues not slight , Which he collected for a friar white . Of these I 've known as good as any black , When husbands some assistance seemed to lack , And had so much to do , they monks might need ; Or other friends , their work at home to speed . This friar for to-morrow never thought , But squandered ev ` ry thing as soon as brought ; No saint-apostle less of wealth retained ; Good cheer o ` er ev ` ry wish triumphant reigned , Save now and then to have a little fun , -LRB- Unknown to others -RRB- with a pretty nun . FERONDE had got a spouse of pleasing sight , Related nearly to our friar white , Whose predecessor , uncle , sponsor kind , Now gone to realms of night , had her consigned , To be this silly blockhead 's lawful wife , Who thought her hand the honor of his life . ` Tis said that bastard-daughters oft retain A disposition to the parent-train ; And this , the saying , truly ne'er bellied , Nor was her spouse so weak but he descried , Things clearer than was requisite believed , And doubted much if he were not deceived . THE wife would often to the prelate go , Pretending business , proper he should know ; A thousand circumstances she could find ; 'Twas then accounts : now sev ` ral things combined ; In short no day nor hour within the week , But something at the friar 's she would seek . The holy father then was always prone , To send the servants off and be alone . Howe'er the husband , doubting tricks were played ; Got troublesome ; his wife would much upbraid When she returned , and often beat her too ; In short , -- he unaccommodating grew . THE rural mind by nature jealous proves ; Suspicion shows of ev ` ry thing that moves ; Unused to city ways , perverse appears , And , undismayed , to principle adheres : THE friar found his situation hard ; He loved his ease ? -- all trouble would discard ; As priests in gen ` ral anxiously desire ; Their plan howe'er I never can admire , And should not choose at once to take the town , But by the escalade obtain the crown ; In LOVE I mean ; to WAR I do n't allude : No silly bragging I would here intrude , Nor be enrolled among the martial train : ` Tis Venus ' court that I should like to gain . Let t ` other custom be the better way : It matters not ; no longer I 'll delay , But to my tale return , and fully state , How our receiver , who misused his mate ; Was put in purgatory to be cured , And , for a time , most thoroughly immured . BY means of opiate powders , much renowned , The friar plunged him in a sleep profound . Thought dead ; the fun ` ral obsequies achieved , He was surprised , and doubtless sorely grieved , When he awoke and saw where he was placed , With folks around , not much to suit his taste ; For in the coffin he at large was left , And of the pow ` r to move was not bereft , But might arise and walk about the tomb , Which opened to another vaulted room , The gloomy , hollow mansion of the dead : Fear quickly o ` er his drooping spirits spread . What 's here ? cried he : is ` t sleep , or is it death ; Some charm or spell perhaps withdraws their breath . Our wight then asked their names and business there ; And why he was retained in such a snare ? In what had he offended God or man ? -- Said one , console thyself : -- past moments scan ; When thou hast rested here a thousand years , Thou ` lt then ascend amid the Heav ` nly spheres ; But first in holy purgatory learn , To cleanse thyself from sins that we discern ; One day thy soul shall leave this loathsome place , And , pure as ice , repair to realms of grace . Then this consoling Angel gave a thwack , And ten or dozen stripes laid on his back : -- ` Tis thy unruly , jealous mind , said he , Displeases God , and dooms thee here to be . A MOURNFUL sigh the lorn receiver heaved , His aching shoulders rubbed , and sobbed and grieved ; A thousand years , cried he , ` tis long indeed ! My very soul with horror seems to bleed . WE should observe , this Angel was a wag , A novice-friar and a convent fag ; Like him the others round had parts to act , And were disguised in dresses quite exact . Our penitent most humbly pardon sought ; Said he , if e ` er to life again I 'm brought , No jealousy , suspicion 's hateful bane , Shall ever enter my distracted brain . May I not have this grace , this wished for boon ? Some hopes they gave , but it could not be soon ; In short a year he lay upon the floor : Just food for life received , and nothing more , Each day on bread and water he was fed , And o ` er his back the cat-o ` nine-tails spread : Full twenty lashes were the number set , Unless the friar should from Heav ` n first get Permission to remit at times a part , For charity was glowing in his heart . WE , must not doubt , he often offered prayers , To ease the culprit 's sufferings and cares . The Angel likewise made a long discourse ; Said he , those vile suspicions were the source , Of all thy sorrow , wretchedness , and pain : Think ` st thou such thoughts the clergy entertain ? A friar white ! -- too bad in ev ` ry sense : Ten strokes to one , if black , for such offence . Repent , I say : -- the other this desired , Though scarcely he could tell what was required . MEANWHILE the prelate with the fav ` rite dame , No time to lose , made ev ` ry hour the same . The husband , with a sigh , was heard to say : I wonder what my wife 's about to-day ? About ? -- whate'er it be ` tis doubtless right ; Our friar , to console her , takes delight ; Thy business too is managed as before , And anxious care bestowed upon thy store . HAS she as usual matters that demand Attendance at the cloister to be scanned ? -- No doubt was the reply , for having now The whole affair upon her feeble brow , Poor woman ! be her wishes what they will , She more assistance wants thy loss to fill . DISCOURSE like this no pleasure gave the soul : To call him so seems best upon the whole , Since he 'd not pow ` r like others here to feed : -- Mere earthly shadow for a time decreed . A MONTH was passed in fasting , pains , and prayer ; Some charity the friar made him share , And now and then remission would direct ; The widow too he never would neglect , But , all the consolation in his pow ` r , Bestowed upon her ev ` ry leisure hour , His tender cares unfruitful were not long ; Beyond his hopes the soil proved good and strong ; In short our Pater Abbas justly feared , To make him father many signs appeared . SINCE ` twere improper such a fact were known ; When proofs perhaps too clearly might be shown , So many prayers were said and vigils kept , At length the soul from purgatory crept , So much reduced , and ev ` ry way so thin But little more he seemed than bones and skin . A THING so strange filled numbers with surprise , Who scarcely would believe their ears and eyes . The friar passed for saint : -- Feronde his fruit ; None durst presume to doubt nor to dispute ; A double miracle at once appeared The dead 's return : the lady 's state revered . With treble force Te Deum round was sung ; Sterility in marriage oft was rung , And near the convent many offered prayers , In hopes their fervent vows would gain them heirs . THE humble spouse and wife we now shall leave Let none , howe'er , suppose that we conceive , Each husband merits , as our soul , the same , To cure the jealous fears his breast inflame .
