Anne she fancied she had only half a soul , and that her child had taken the other half down into the sea . Never would she be able to swing herself aloft to the mercy of Heaven , till she had recovered this other half , which was now held fast in the deep water . Anne Lisbeth got back to her former home , but was no longer the woman she had been : her thoughts were confused like a tangled skein ; only one thread , only one thought she had disentangled , namely , that she must carry the spectre of the sea shore to the churchyard , and dig a grave for him , that thus she might win back her soul . Many a night she was missed from her home ; and she was always found on the sea shore , waiting for the spectre . In this way a whole year passed by ; and then one night she vanished again , and was not to be found ; the whole of the next day was wasted in fruitless search . Towards evening , when the clerk came into the church to toll the vesper bell , he saw by the altar Anne Lisbeth , who had spent the whole day there . Her physical forces were almost exhausted , but her eyes gleamed brightly , and her cheeks had a rosy flush . The last rays of the sun shone upon her , and gleamed over the altar on the bright buckles of the Bible which lay there , opened at the words of the prophet Joel : `` Bend your hearts , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord ! '' That was just a chance , the people said ; as many things happen by chance . In the face of Anne Lisbeth , illumined by the sun , peace and rest were to be seen . She said she was happy , for now she had conquered . Last night the spectre of the shore , her own child , had come to her , and had said to her , `` Thou hast dug me only half a grave , but thou hast now , for a year and a day , buried me altogether in thy heart , and it is there that a mother can best hide her child ! '' And then he gave her her lost soul back again , and brought her here into the church . `` Now I am in the house of God , '' she said , `` and in that house we are happy . '' And when the sun had set , Anne Lisbeth 's soul had risen to that region where there is no more anguish , and Anne Lisbeth 's troubles were over .
