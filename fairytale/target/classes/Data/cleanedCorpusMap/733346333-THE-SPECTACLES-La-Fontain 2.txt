I LATELY vowed to leave the nuns alone , So oft their freaks have in my page been shown . The subject may at length fatigue the mind ; My Muse the veil howe'er is still inclined , Conspicuously to hold to publick view , And , ` mong the sisters , scene and scene pursue . Is this too much ? -- the nicest tricks they play ; Through soft amours oft artfully they stray , And these in full I 'd readily detail , If I were sure the subject would not fail ; And that 's impossible I must admit , ` Twould endless be , the tales appear so fit ; There 's not a clerk so expeditious found , Who could record the stories known around . The sisters to forget , were I to try , Suspicions might arise that , by and by , I should return : some case might tempt my pen ; So oft I 've overrun the convent-den , Like one who always makes , from time to time , The conversation with his feelings chime . But let us to an end the subject bring , And after this , of other matters sing . IN former times was introduced a lad Among the nuns , and like a maiden clad ; A charming girl by all he was believed ; Fifteen his age ; no doubts were then conceived ; Coletta was the name the youth had brought , And , till he got a beard , was sister thought . THE period howsoe'er was well employed , And from it Agnes profit had enjoyed ; What profit ? -- truly better had I said , That sister Agnes by him was misled , And store of ills received ; misfortune dire Obliged the nun more girdle to require , And ultimately to produce -LRB- in spite Of ev ` ry wish to guard the fact from light -RRB- A little creature that our hist ` ries say , Was found Coletta 's features to display . GREAT scandal quickly through the convent ran : How could this child arrive ? -- the sisters ` gan To laugh and ask , if in an evil hour , The mushroom could have fallen with a show ` r ? Or self-created was it not supposed ? Much rage the abbess presently disclosed ; To have her holy mansion thus disgraced ! Forthwith the culprit was in prison placed . THE father to discover next they tried ; How could he enter , pass , escape , or hide ; The walls were high ; the grate was double too ; Quite small the turning-box appeared to view , And she who managed it was very old : -- Perhaps some youthful spark has been so bold , Cried she who was superior to the rest , To get admitted , like a maiden dressed , And ` mong our flock -LRB- if rightly I surmise -RRB- A wicked wolf is lurking in disguise . Undress , I say , I 'll verify the fact ; No other way remains for me to act . THE lad disguised was terrified to death ; Each plan was dissipated with a breath ; The more he thought of means from thence to get , The greater were the obstacles he met . At length NECESSITY -LRB- the parent found Of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned , -RRB- Induced the youth ... -LRB- I scarcely can proceed -RRB- To tie ... expression here I clearly need ; What word will decently express the thought ? What book has got it ? -- where should it be sought ? You 've heard , in days of yore that human kind , With windows in their bosoms were designed , Through which 'twas easy all within to see , And suited those of medical degree . BUT if these windows useful were believed ; 'Twas inconvenient in the heart perceived , And women thoroughly disliked the scheme : -- They could not find the means to hide a dream . Dame Nature howsoe'er contrived a plan : -- One lace she gave the woman , one the man , Of equal length , and each enough no doubt , By proper care to shut the ope throughout . The woman much too thick her eyelets placed ; And consequently , ne'er was closely laced ; The fault was all her own : herself the cause ; The man as little merited applause , For coarsely working , soon the hole was shut , From which the remnant lace was left to jut ; In fact , on either side , whate'er was done , The laces never equally would run , And we are told , both sexes acted wrong : The woman 's was too short ; the man 's too long . FROM this ` tis easy , it should seem to guess : What by the youth was tied in this distress The end of lace that by the men was left , When nature ordered them to close the cleft : With thread he fastened it so very well , That all was flat as any nun or belle ; But thread or silk , you can not find a string To hold , what soon I fear will give a spring , And get away , in spite of all you do ; Bring saints or angels such a scene to view , As twenty nuns in similar array , Strange creatures I should think them : -- merely clay , If they should at the sight unmoved remain ; I speak of nuns , howe'er , whose charms maintain Superior rank , and like the Graces seem , Delightful sisters ! ev ` ry way supreme . THE prioress , this secret to disclose , Appeared with spectacles upon her nose ; And twenty nuns around a dress displayed ; That convent mantua-makers never made , Imagine to yourself what felt the youth , ` Mid this examination of the truth . The nice proportions and the lily charms Soon raised within his bosom dire alarms ; Like magick operated on the string , And from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring ; Broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed , That , having slipt its halter , flies with speed ; Against the abbess ' nose with force it flew , And spectacles from her proboscis threw . THOUGH she had nearly fallen on the floor , In thus attempting secrets to explore , No jest she thought the accident , 'twas plain , But would with force the discipline maintain . A chapter instantly the lady held ; Long time upon the circumstance they dwelled . The youthful wolf that caused the direful shock ; At length was given to the aged flock , Who tied his hands and bound him to a tree Face ` gainst the wood , that none his front might see ; And while the cruel troop , with rage inflamed , Considered of rewards that vengeance framed ; While some the besoms from the kitchen brought ; And others , in the convent ars ` nal sought The various instruments the sisters used To punish when obedience was refused ; Another double-locked , within a room . The nuns of tender hearts and youthful bloom : -- By chance , a friend to sly gallants appeared , And soon removed , what most our hero feared : A miller mounted on his mule came by , A tight-built active lad with piercing eye ; One much admired by all the girls around ; Played well at kayles : -- a good companion found . Aha ! cried he , what 's here ? -- a nice affair ; Young man , pray tell me who has placed thee there ? The sisters , say ` st thou ? -- hast thou had thy fun , And pleased thy fancy with a wanton nun ? Art satisfied ? -- and was she pretty too ? In truth , to judge by what appears to view , Thou seemest thoroughly a wily wight , That convent belles would relish morn and night . ALAS ! replied the other with a sigh , In vain the nuns my virtue sought to try ; 'Twas my misfortune : -- patience heav ` n bestow ; For worlds such wickedness I would not know . THE miller laughed at what the other spoke ; Untied his hands , and ev ` ry bandage broke . Said he , thou ninny , scruples can ` st thou find To counteract , and prove to pleasure blind ? The business clearly should to me belong ; Our rector ne'er had thought such conduct wrong , And never would have played the fool like this ; Fly , haste away , away ; I 'll thee dismiss , First having nicely set me in thy place ; Like me thou wert not formed for soft embrace ; I 'm stout and able : -- quarter ne'er will ask ; Come ALL , these nuns , I 'll execute the task , And many pranks they 'll see , unless a freak Should happen any way the string to break . The other never asked his wishes twice , But tied him well , and left him in a trice . WITH shoulders broad the miller you might see ; In Adam 's birth-attire against the tree , Await the coming of the aged band , Who soon appeared , with tapers in the hand , In solemn guise , and whips and scourges dire : The virgin troop -LRB- as convent laws require -RRB- In full procession moved around the Wight ; Without allowing time to catch his sight , Or giving notice what they meant to do : How now ! cried he : -- why wo n't you take a view ? Deceived you are ; regard me well I pray ; I 'm not the silly fool you had to-day , Who woman hates , and scruples seeks to raise : Employ but me , and soon I 'll gain your praise ; I 'll wonders execute ; my strength appears ; And ; if I fail , at once cut off my ears . At certain pleasant play I 'm clever found ; But as to whips -- I never was renowned . WHAT means the fellow ? cried a toothless nun ; What would he tell us ? Hast thou nothing done ? How ! -- Art thou not our brat-begetter ? -- speak ; So much the worse : -- on thee our rage we 'll wreak , For him that 's gone we 'll make thee suffer now ; Once arms in hand , we never will allow Such characters full punishment to miss ; The play that we desire is THIS and THIS ; Then whips and scourges round him ` gan to move , And not a little troublesome to prove The miller , writhing with the poignant smart , Cried loudly : -- I 'll exert my utmost art , Good ladies , to perform what is your due ; The more he bawled , the faster lashes flew . This work so well the aged troop achieved , He long remembered what his skin received . WHILE thus the master chastisement had got ; His mule was feeding on the verdant spot . But what became of this or that , at last , I 've never heard , and care not how it past . ` Tis quite enough to save the young gallant , And more particulars we do not want . My readers , for a time , could they obtain A dozen nuns like these , where beauties reign , Would doubtless not be seen without their dress ! We do not always ev ` ry wish express .
